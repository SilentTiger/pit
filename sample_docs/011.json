{"insert":"　　M. MYRIEL ","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"e0cb"}},
{"insert":"　　In 1815, M. Charles-Francois-Bienvenu Myriel was Bishop of D---- He was an old man of about seventy-five years of age; he had occupied the see of D---- since 1806.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"cb75"}},
{"insert":"　　Although this detail has no connection whatever with the real substance of what we are about to relate, it will not be superfluous, if merely for the sake of exactness in all points, to mention here the various rumors and remarks which had been in circulation about him from the very moment when he arrived in the diocese.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"0484"}},
{"insert":"　　True or false, that which is said of men often occupies as important a place in their lives, and above all in their destinies, as that which they do. M. Myriel was the son of a councillor of the Parliament of Aix; hence he belonged to the nobility of the bar.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"1edc"}},
{"insert":"　　It was said that his father, destining him to be the heir of his own post, had married him at a very early age, eighteen or twenty, in accordance with a custom which is rather widely prevalent in parliamentary families. In spite of this marriage, however, it was said that Charles Myriel created a great deal of talk.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ca69"}},
{"insert":"　　He was well formed, though rather short in stature, elegant, graceful, intelligent; the whole of the first portion of his life had been devoted to the world and to gallantry.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ece2"}},
{"insert":"　　The Revolution came; events succeeded each other with precipitation; the parliamentary families, decimated, pursued, hunted down, were dispersed.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4bad"}},
{"insert":"　　M. Charles Myriel emigrated to Italy at the very beginning of the Revolution.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"52a1"}},
{"insert":"　　There his wife died of a malady of the chest, from which she had long suffered.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"8e49"}},
{"insert":"　　He had no children. What took place next in the fate of M. Myriel?","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"f408"}},
{"insert":"　　The ruin of the French society of the olden days, the fall of his own family, the tragic spectacles of '93, which were, perhaps, even more alarming to the emigrants who viewed them from a distance, with the magnifying powers of terror,--did these cause the ideas of renunciation and solitude to germinate in him?","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a7c5"}},
{"insert":"　　Was he, in the midst of these distractions, these affections which absorbed his life, suddenly smitten with one of those mysterious and terrible blows which sometimes overwhelm, by striking to his heart, a man whom public catastrophes would not shake, by striking at his existence and his fortune?","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"bb5e"}},
{"insert":"　　No one could have told:","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"7ddc"}},
{"insert":"　　all that was known was, that when he returned from Italy he was a priest.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"958d"}},
{"insert":"　　In 1804, M. Myriel was the Cure of B---- [Brignolles]. He was already advanced in years, and lived in a very retired manner.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"c262"}},
{"insert":"　　About the epoch of the coronation, some petty affair connected with his curacy--just what, is not precisely known--took him to Paris.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"6bbc"}},
{"insert":"　　Among other powerful persons to whom he went to solicit aid for his parishioners was M. le Cardinal Fesch.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"f08e"}},
{"insert":"　　One day, when the Emperor had come to visit his uncle, the worthy Cure, who was waiting in the anteroom, found himself present when His Majesty passed.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4bfd"}},
{"insert":"　　Napoleon, on finding himself observed with a certain curiosity by this old man, turned round and said abruptly:--","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a1c5"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Who is this good man who is staring at me?\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"c20c"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Sire,\" said M. Myriel, \"you are looking at a good man, and I at a great man.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"6867"}},
{"insert":"　　Each of us can profit by it.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"574f"}},
{"insert":"　　That very evening, the Emperor asked the Cardinal the name of the Cure, and some time afterwards M. Myriel was utterly astonished to learn that he had been appointed Bishop of D----","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"d4bf"}},
{"insert":"　　What truth was there, after all, in the stories which were invented as to the early portion of M. Myriel's life?","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"9953"}},
{"insert":"　　No one knew. Very few families had been acquainted with the Myriel family before the Revolution.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"b1d5"}},
{"insert":"　　M. Myriel had to undergo the fate of every newcomer in a little town, where there are many mouths which talk, and very few heads which think. He was obliged to undergo it although he was a bishop, and because he was a bishop.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"405e"}},
{"insert":"　　But after all, the rumors with which his name was connected were rumors only,--noise, sayings, words; less than words-- palabres, as the energetic language of the South expresses it.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"6961"}},
{"insert":"　　However that may be, after nine years of episcopal power and of residence in D----, all the stories and subjects of conversation which engross petty towns and petty people at the outset had fallen into profound oblivion.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"9d10"}},
{"insert":"　　No one would have dared to mention them; no one would have dared to recall them.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"9a75"}},
{"insert":"　　M. Myriel had arrived at D---- accompanied by an elderly spinster, Mademoiselle Baptistine, who was his sister, and ten years his junior.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"25fe"}},
{"insert":"　　Their only domestic was a female servant of the same age as Mademoiselle Baptistine, and named Madame Magloire, who, after having been the servant of M. le Cure, now assumed the double title of maid to Mademoiselle and housekeeper to Monseigneur.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4f25"}},
{"insert":"　　Mademoiselle Baptistine was a long, pale, thin, gentle creature; she realized the ideal expressed by the word \"respectable\"; for it seems that a woman must needs be a mother in order to be venerable. She had never been pretty; her whole life, which had been nothing but a succession of holy deeds, had finally conferred upon her a sort of pallor and transparency; and as she advanced in years she had acquired what may be called the beauty of goodness. What had been leanness in her youth had become transparency in her maturity; and this diaphaneity allowed the angel to be seen. She was a soul rather than a virgin.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"28b0"}},
{"insert":"　　Her person seemed made of a shadow; there was hardly sufficient body to provide for sex; a little matter enclosing a light; large eyes forever drooping;-- a mere pretext for a soul's remaining on the earth.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"6820"}},
{"insert":"　　Madame Magloire was a little, fat, white old woman, corpulent and bustling; always out of breath,--in the first place, because of her activity, and in the next, because of her asthma.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"688d"}},
{"insert":"　　On his arrival, M. Myriel was installed in the episcopal palace with the honors required by the Imperial decrees, which class a bishop immediately after a major-general. The mayor and the president paid the first call on him, and he, in turn, paid the first call on the general and the prefect.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"cf2a"}},
{"insert":"　　The installation over, the town waited to see its bishop at work.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　M. MYRIEL BECOMES M. WELCOME ","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"809f"}},
{"insert":"　　The episcopal palace of D---- adjoins the hospital.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"c0d0"}},
{"insert":"　　The episcopal palace was a huge and beautiful house, built of stone at the beginning of the last century by M. Henri Puget, Doctor of Theology of the Faculty of Paris, Abbe of Simore, who had been Bishop of D---- in 1712.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"88cd"}},
{"insert":"　　This palace was a genuine seignorial residence. Everything about it had a grand air,--the apartments of the Bishop, the drawing-rooms, the chambers, the principal courtyard, which was very large, with walks encircling it under arcades in the old Florentine fashion, and gardens planted with magnificent trees. In the dining-room, a long and superb gallery which was situated on the ground-floor and opened on the gardens, M. Henri Puget had entertained in state, on July 29, 1714, My Lords Charles Brulart de Genlis, archbishop; Prince d'Embrun; Antoine de Mesgrigny, the capuchin, Bishop of Grasse; Philippe de Vendome, Grand Prior of France, Abbe of Saint Honore de Lerins; Francois de Berton de Crillon, bishop, Baron de Vence; Cesar de Sabran de Forcalquier, bishop, Seignor of Glandeve; and Jean Soanen, Priest of the Oratory, preacher in ordinary to the king, bishop, Seignor of Senez. The portraits of these seven reverend personages decorated this apartment; and this memorable date, the 29th of July, 1714, was there engraved in letters of gold on a table of white marble.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"acfe"}},
{"insert":"　　The hospital was a low and narrow building of a single story, with a small garden.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"c561"}},
{"insert":"　　Three days after his arrival, the Bishop visited the hospital. The visit ended, he had the director requested to be so good as to come to his house.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"cb3e"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Monsieur the director of the hospital,\" said he to him, \"how many sick people have you at the present moment?\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"83e2"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Twenty-six, Monseigneur.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"0e36"}},
{"insert":"　　\"That was the number which I counted,\" said the Bishop.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"2352"}},
{"insert":"　　\"The beds,\" pursued the director, \"are very much crowded against each other.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"14b7"}},
{"insert":"　　\"That is what I observed.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"6723"}},
{"insert":"　　\"The halls are nothing but rooms, and it is with difficulty that the air can be changed in them.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"e07d"}},
{"insert":"　　\"So it seems to me.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"138a"}},
{"insert":"　　\"And then, when there is a ray of sun, the garden is very small for the convalescents.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"bfd2"}},
{"insert":"　　\"That was what I said to myself.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"cd3b"}},
{"insert":"　　\"In case of epidemics,--we have had the typhus fever this year; we had the sweating sickness two years ago, and a hundred patients at times,--we know not what to do.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ea93"}},
{"insert":"　　\"That is the thought which occurred to me.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"d6cd"}},
{"insert":"　　\"What would you have, Monseigneur?\" said the director.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"e9b9"}},
{"insert":"　　\"One must resign one's self.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"b722"}},
{"insert":"　　This conversation took place in the gallery dining-room on the ground-floor.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"9abb"}},
{"insert":"　　The Bishop remained silent for a moment; then he turned abruptly to the director of the hospital.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"e1c2"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Monsieur,\" said he, \"how many beds do you think this hall alone would hold?\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"aaee"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Monseigneur's dining-room?\" exclaimed the stupefied director.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"eab2"}},
{"insert":"　　The Bishop cast a glance round the apartment, and seemed to be taking measures and calculations with his eyes.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"dcfd"}},
{"insert":"　　\"It would hold full twenty beds,\" said he, as though speaking to himself.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"73e3"}},
{"insert":"　　Then, raising his voice:--","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"77dc"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Hold, Monsieur the director of the hospital, I will tell you something. There is evidently a mistake here.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"e539"}},
{"insert":"　　There are thirty-six of you, in five or six small rooms.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a911"}},
{"insert":"　　There are three of us here, and we have room for sixty.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"aa75"}},
{"insert":"　　There is some mistake, I tell you; you have my house, and I have yours.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"9d5c"}},
{"insert":"　　Give me back my house; you are at home here.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"46b5"}},
{"insert":"　　On the following day the thirty-six patients were installed in the Bishop's palace, and the Bishop was settled in the hospital.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4d7b"}},
{"insert":"　　M. Myriel had no property, his family having been ruined by the Revolution.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3e9c"}},
{"insert":"　　His sister was in receipt of a yearly income of five hundred francs, which sufficed for her personal wants at the vicarage.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"9e1a"}},
{"insert":"　　M. Myriel received from the State, in his quality of bishop, a salary of fifteen thousand francs.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ad08"}},
{"insert":"　　On the very day when he took up his abode in the hospital, M. Myriel settled on the disposition of this sum once for all, in the following manner. We transcribe here a note made by his own hand:--","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"e0e7"}},
{"insert":"　　This arrangement was accepted with absolute submission by Mademoiselle Baptistine.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"c2ff"}},
{"insert":"　　This holy woman regarded Monseigneur of D---- as at one and the same time her brother and her bishop, her friend according to the flesh and her superior according to the Church. She simply loved and venerated him.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ec1a"}},
{"insert":"　　When he spoke, she bowed; when he acted, she yielded her adherence.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"42e0"}},
{"insert":"　　Their only servant, Madame Magloire, grumbled a little.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"9fcd"}},
{"insert":"　　It will be observed that Monsieur the Bishop had reserved for himself only one thousand livres, which, added to the pension of Mademoiselle Baptistine, made fifteen hundred francs a year.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　On these fifteen hundred francs these two old women and the old man subsisted.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　And when a village curate came to D----, the Bishop still found means to entertain him, thanks to the severe economy of Madame Magloire, and to the intelligent administration of Mademoiselle Baptistine.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ee66"}},
{"insert":"　　One day, after he had been in D---- about three months, the Bishop said:--","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　\"Hold!\" cried the Bishop, \"you are quite right, Madame Magloire.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　And he made his demand.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"033a"}},
{"insert":"　　Some time afterwards the General Council took this demand under consideration, and voted him an annual sum of three thousand francs, under this heading:","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　This provoked a great outcry among the local burgesses; and a senator of the Empire, a former member of the Council of the Five Hundred which favored the 18 Brumaire, and who was provided with a magnificent senatorial office in the vicinity of the town of D----, wrote to M. Bigot de Preameneu, the minister of public worship, a very angry and confidential note on the subject, from which we extract these authentic lines:--","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"99ec"}},

{"insert":"　　In fact, when the scaffold is there, all erected and prepared, it has something about it which produces hallucination. One may feel a certain indifference to the death penalty, one may refrain from pronouncing upon it, from saying yes or no, so long as one has not seen a guillotine with one's own eyes: but if one encounters one of them, the shock is violent; one is forced to decide, and to take part for or against. Some admire it, like de Maistre; others execrate it, like Beccaria. The guillotine is the concretion of the law; it is called vindicte; it is not neutral, and it does not permit you to remain neutral. He who sees it shivers with the most mysterious of shivers.

{"insert":"　　It seems as though it were a being, possessed of I know not what sombre initiative; one would say that this piece of carpenter's work saw, that this machine heard, that this mechanism understood, that this wood, this iron, and these cords were possessed of will.

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"28eb"}},
{"insert":"　　The scaffold is the accomplice of the executioner; it devours, it eats flesh, it drinks blood; the scaffold is a sort of monster fabricated by the judge and the carpenter, a spectre which seems to live with a horrible vitality composed of all the death which it has inflicted.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　A glazed door opened on the garden; opposite this was the bed,--a hospital bed of iron, with a canopy of green serge; in the shadow of the bed, behind a curtain, were the utensils of the toilet, which still betrayed the elegant habits of the man of the world: there were two doors, one near the chimney, opening into the oratory; the other near the bookcase, opening into the dining-room. The bookcase was a large cupboard with glass doors filled with books; the chimney was of wood painted to represent marble, and habitually without fire. In the chimney stood a pair of firedogs of iron, ornamented above with two garlanded vases, and flutings which had formerly been silvered with silver leaf, which was a sort of episcopal luxury; above the chimney-piece hung a crucifix of copper, with the silver worn off, fixed on a background of threadbare velvet in a wooden frame from which the gilding had fallen; near the glass door a large table with an inkstand, loaded with a confusion of papers and with huge volumes; before the table an arm-chair of straw; in front of the bed a prie-Dieu, borrowed from the oratory.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　It must be confessed, however, that he still retained from his former possessions six silver knives and forks and a soup-ladle, which Madame Magloire contemplated every day with delight, as they glistened splendidly upon the coarse linen cloth.

{"insert":"　　To this silverware must be added two large candlesticks of massive silver, which he had inherited from a great-aunt.

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"f4a4"}},

{"insert":"　　He had not voted for the death of the king, but almost.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"b85e"}},
{"insert":"　　He was a quasi-regicide. He had been a terrible man. How did it happen that such a man had not been brought before a provost's court, on the return of the legitimate princes? They need not have cut off his head, if you please; clemency must be exercised, agreed; but a good banishment for life.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　Yes; if he were to be judged by the element of ferocity in this solitude of his.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"9270"}},
{"insert":"　　As he had not voted for the death of the king, he had not been included in the decrees of exile, and had been able to remain in France.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3eea"}},
{"insert":"　　He dwelt at a distance of three-quarters of an hour from the city, far from any hamlet, far from any road, in some hidden turn of a very wild valley, no one knew exactly where.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4176"}},
{"insert":"　　He had there, it was said, a sort of field, a hole, a lair.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"947f"}},
{"insert":"　　There were no neighbors, not even passers-by. Since he had dwelt in that valley, the path which led thither had disappeared under a growth of grass. The locality was spoken of as though it had been the dwelling of a hangman.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"7191"}},
{"insert":"　　Nevertheless, the Bishop meditated on the subject, and from time to time he gazed at the horizon at a point where a clump of trees marked the valley of the former member of the Convention, and he said, \"There is a soul yonder which is lonely.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ff6d"}},
{"insert":"　　And he added, deep in his own mind, \"I owe him a visit.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3754"}},
{"insert":"　　But, let us avow it, this idea, which seemed natural at the first blush, appeared to him after a moment's reflection, as strange, impossible, and almost repulsive.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"84e4"}},
{"insert":"　　For, at bottom, he shared the general impression, and the old member of the Convention inspired him, without his being clearly conscious of the fact himself, with that sentiment which borders on hate, and which is so well expressed by the word estrangement.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"98f8"}},
{"insert":"　　Still, should the scab of the sheep cause the shepherd to recoil? No. But what a sheep!","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"f2bc"}},
{"insert":"　　The good Bishop was perplexed.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"e6f0"}},
{"insert":"　　Sometimes he set out in that direction; then he returned.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3582"}},
{"insert":"　　Finally, the rumor one day spread through the town that a sort of young shepherd, who served the member of the Convention in his hovel, had come in quest of a doctor; that the old wretch was dying, that paralysis was gaining on him, and that he would not live over night.--\"Thank God!\" some added.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5b69"}},
{"insert":"　　The Bishop took his staff, put on his cloak, on account of his too threadbare cassock, as we have mentioned, and because of the evening breeze which was sure to rise soon, and set out.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"2856"}},
{"insert":"　　The sun was setting, and had almost touched the horizon when the Bishop arrived at the excommunicated spot.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"13f7"}},
{"insert":"　　With a certain beating of the heart, he recognized the fact that he was near the lair. He strode over a ditch, leaped a hedge, made his way through a fence of dead boughs, entered a neglected paddock, took a few steps with a good deal of boldness, and suddenly, at the extremity of the waste land, and behind lofty brambles, he caught sight of the cavern.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"833f"}},
{"insert":"　　It was a very low hut, poor, small, and clean, with a vine nailed against the outside.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"dd96"}},
{"insert":"　　Near the door, in an old wheel-chair, the arm-chair of the peasants, there was a white-haired man, smiling at the sun.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　Near the seated man stood a young boy, the shepherd lad. He was offering the old man a jar of milk.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"05c0"}},
{"insert":"　　While the Bishop was watching him, the old man spoke:","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　\"Thank you,\" he said, \"I need nothing.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"98f3"}},
{"insert":"　　And his smile quitted the sun to rest upon the child.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5c65"}},
{"insert":"　　The Bishop stepped forward.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"d47c"}},
{"insert":"　　At the sound which he made in walking, the old man turned his head, and his face expressed the sum total of the surprise which a man can still feel after a long life.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"e59a"}},
{"insert":"　　\"This is the first time since I have been here,\" said he, \"that any one has entered here.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　Who are you, sir?\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"be5e"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"18fe"}},
{"insert":"　　\"I am.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"fa00"}},
{"insert":"　　The old man resumed with a half-smile","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"8a82"}},
{"insert":"　　\"In that case, you are my bishop?\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"663f"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Enter, sir.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"bbc1"}},
{"insert":"　　The member of the Convention extended his hand to the Bishop, but the Bishop did not take it.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"0957"}},
{"insert":"　　The Bishop confined himself to the remark:--","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　\"I am pleased to see that I have been misinformed.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　You certainly do not seem to me to be ill.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　\"Monsieur,\" replied the old man, \"I am going to recover.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"2068"}},

{"insert":"　　\"I shall die three hours hence.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3d83"}},

{"insert":"　　\"I am something of a doctor; I know in what fashion the last hour draws on.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　Yesterday, only my feet were cold; to-day, the chill has ascended to my knees; now I feel it mounting to my waist; when it reaches the heart, I shall stop.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"8485"}},
{"insert":"　　The sun is beautiful, is it not?","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"7586"}},

{"insert":"　　You can talk to me; it does not fatigue me.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"677e"}},
{"insert":"　　One has one's caprices; I should have liked to last until the dawn, but I know that I shall hardly live three hours.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"109d"}},
{"insert":"　　It will be night then. What does it matter, after all?","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"9f4f"}},
{"insert":"　　Dying is a simple affair. One has no need of the light for that.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"f04a"}},
{"insert":"　　So be it.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"28d5"}},
{"insert":"　　I shall die by starlight.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"6ff1"}},
{"insert":"　　The old man turned to the shepherd lad:--","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　\"Go to thy bed; thou wert awake all last night; thou art tired.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"6b7e"}},
{"insert":"　　The child entered the hut.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"db8c"}},
{"insert":"　　The old man followed him with his eyes, and added, as though speaking to himself:--","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5e6b"}},
{"insert":"　　The Bishop was not touched as it seems that he should have been. He did not think he discerned God in this manner of dying; let us say the whole, for these petty contradictions of great hearts must be indicated like the rest:","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"dbb1"}},
{"insert":"　　he, who on occasion, was so fond of laughing at \"His Grace,\" was rather shocked at not being addressed as Monseigneur, and he was almost tempted to retort \"citizen.\" He was assailed by a fancy for peevish familiarity, common enough to doctors and priests, but which was not habitual with him. This man, after all, this member of the Convention, this representative of the people, had been one of the powerful ones of the earth; for the first time in his life, probably, the Bishop felt in a mood to be severe.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3e39"}},
{"insert":"　　Meanwhile, the member of the Convention had been surveying him with a modest cordiality, in which one could have distinguished, possibly, that humility which is so fitting when one is on the verge of returning to dust.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"f07e"}},
{"insert":"　　The Bishop, on his side, although he generally restrained his curiosity, which, in his opinion, bordered on a fault, could not refrain from examining the member of the Convention with an attention which, as it did not have its course in sympathy, would have served his conscience as a matter of reproach, in connection with any other man. A member of the Convention produced on him somewhat the effect of being outside the pale of the law, even of the law of charity.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　G----, calm, his body almost upright, his voice vibrating, was one of those octogenarians who form the subject of astonishment to the physiologist. The Revolution had many of these men, proportioned to the epoch. In this old man one was conscious of a man put to the proof. Though so near to his end, he preserved all the gestures of health. In his clear glance, in his firm tone, in the robust movement of his shoulders, there was something calculated to disconcert death.

You are a prelate,--revenues, palace, horses, servants, good table, all the sensualities of life; you have this like the rest, and like the rest, you enjoy it; it is well; but this says either too much or too little; this does not enlighten me upon the intrinsic and essential value of the man who comes with the probable intention of bringing wisdom to me.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　The arrest of the Pope took place, as every one knows, on the night of the 5th to the 6th of July, 1809; on this occasion, M. Myriel was summoned by Napoleon to the synod of the bishops of France and Italy convened at Paris.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　Let us remark, by the way, that the hatred of luxury is not an intelligent hatred.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"205f"}},
{"insert":"　　This hatred would involve the hatred of the arts.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"087c"}},
{"insert":"　　Nevertheless, in churchmen, luxury is wrong, except in connection with representations and ceremonies.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"600c"}},
{"insert":"　　It seems to reveal habits which have very little that is charitable about them. An opulent priest is a contradiction.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"977c"}},
{"insert":"　　The priest must keep close to the poor.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"b6ed"}},
{"insert":"　　Now, can one come in contact incessantly night and day with all this distress, all these misfortunes, and this poverty, without having about one's own person a little of that misery, like the dust of labor?","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　It must not be supposed, however, that he shared what we call the \"ideas of the century\" on certain delicate points.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"8915"}},
{"insert":"　　He took very little part in the theological quarrels of the moment, and maintained silence on questions in which Church and State were implicated; but if he had been strongly pressed, it seems that he would have been found to be an ultramontane rather than a gallican.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"78a8"}},
{"insert":"　　Since we are making a portrait, and since we do not wish to conceal anything, we are forced to add that he was glacial towards Napoleon in his decline. Beginning with 1813, he gave in his adherence to or applauded all hostile manifestations.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"1bc2"}},

{"insert":"　　Besides his sister, Mademoiselle Baptistine, he had two brothers, one a general, the other a prefect.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　He wrote to both with tolerable frequency.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"6518"}},
{"insert":"　　He was harsh for a time towards the former, because, holding a command in Provence at the epoch of the disembarkation at Cannes, the general had put himself at the head of twelve hundred men and had pursued the Emperor as though the latter had been a person whom one is desirous of allowing to escape.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"6aaa"}},
{"insert":"　　His correspondence with the other brother, the ex-prefect, a fine, worthy man who lived in retirement at Paris, Rue Cassette, remained more affectionate.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　Thus Monseigneur Bienvenu also had his hour of party spirit, his hour of bitterness, his cloud.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3e04"}},
{"insert":"　　The shadow of the passions of the moment traversed this grand and gentle spirit occupied with eternal things. Certainly, such a man would have done well not to entertain any political opinions.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"d96c"}},
{"insert":"　　Let there be no mistake as to our meaning: we are not confounding what is called \"political opinions\" with the grand aspiration for progress, with the sublime faith, patriotic, democratic, humane, which in our day should be the very foundation of every generous intellect.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　Without going deeply into questions which are only indirectly connected with the subject of this book, we will simply say this:","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4aa9"}},
{"insert":"　　It would have been well if Monseigneur Bienvenu had not been a Royalist, and if his glance had never been, for a single instant, turned away from that serene contemplation in which is distinctly discernible, above the fictions and the hatreds of this world, above the stormy vicissitudes of human things, the beaming of those three pure radiances, truth, justice, and charity.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"8768"}},
{"insert":"　　While admitting that it was not for a political office that God created Monseigneur Welcome, we should have understood and admired his protest in the name of right and liberty, his proud opposition, his just but perilous resistance to the all-powerful Napoleon. But that which pleases us in people who are rising pleases us less in the case of people who are falling.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5b73"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"02ac"}},
{"insert":"　　The denunciator of success is the only legitimate executioner of the fall. As for us, when Providence intervenes and strikes, we let it work. 1812 commenced to disarm us.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"0290"}},
{"insert":"　　In 1813 the cowardly breach of silence of that taciturn legislative body, emboldened by catastrophe, possessed only traits which aroused indignation.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a49d"}},
{"insert":"　　And it was a crime to applaud, in 1814, in the presence of those marshals who betrayed; in the presence of that senate which passed from one dunghill to another, insulting after having deified; in the presence of that idolatry which was loosing its footing and spitting on its idol,-- it was a duty to turn aside the head.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a180"}},
{"insert":"　　In 1815, when the supreme disasters filled the air, when France was seized with a shiver at their sinister approach, when Waterloo could be dimly discerned opening before Napoleon, the mournful acclamation of the army and the people to the condemned of destiny had nothing laughable in it, and, after making all allowance for the despot, a heart like that of the Bishop of D----, ought not perhaps to have failed to recognize the august and touching features presented by the embrace of a great nation and a great man on the brink of the abyss.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"27b8"}},
{"insert":"　　It must be admitted, that even in the political views with which we have just reproached him, and which we are disposed to judge almost with severity, he was tolerant and easy, more so, perhaps, than we who are speaking here.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"e2c7"}},
{"insert":"　　 We are not obliged to sound the Bishop of D---- on the score of orthodoxy.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"e40c"}},
{"insert":"　　In the presence of such a soul we feel ourselves in no mood but respect.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"6752"}},
{"insert":"　　The conscience of the just man should be accepted on his word.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"d0e7"}},
{"insert":"　　Moreover, certain natures being given, we admit the possible development of all beauties of human virtue in a belief that differs from our own.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"1bf4"}},
{"insert":"　　What did he think of this dogma, or of that mystery?","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"23c9"}},
{"insert":"　　These secrets of the inner tribunal of the conscience are known only to the tomb, where souls enter naked.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ae54"}},
{"insert":"　　The point on which we are certain is, that the difficulties of faith never resolved themselves into hypocrisy in his case.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"8897"}},
{"insert":"　　No decay is possible to the diamond. He believed to the extent of his powers.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5ff0"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Credo in Patrem,\" he often exclaimed.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"f7d3"}},
{"insert":"　　Moreover, he drew from good works that amount of satisfaction which suffices to the conscience, and which whispers to a man, \"Thou art with God!\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4dcf"}},
{"insert":"　　The point which we consider it our duty to note is, that outside of and beyond his faith, as it were, the Bishop possessed an excess of love.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"aeab"}},
{"insert":"　　In was in that quarter, quia multum amavit,--because he loved much--that he was regarded as vulnerable by \"serious men,\" \"grave persons\" and \"reasonable people\"; favorite locutions of our sad world where egotism takes its word of command from pedantry. What was this excess of love?","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3b5b"}},
{"insert":"　　It was a serene benevolence which overflowed men, as we have already pointed out, and which, on occasion, extended even to things.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"28c9"}},
{"insert":"　　He lived without disdain. He was indulgent towards God's creation.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"15f5"}},
{"insert":"　　Every man, even the best, has within him a thoughtless harshness which he reserves for animals. The Bishop of D---- had none of that harshness, which is peculiar to many priests, nevertheless.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"f8c2"}},
{"insert":"　　He did not go as far as the Brahmin, but he seemed to have weighed this saying of Ecclesiastes:","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　This revery sometimes caused him to utter odd sayings.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　One morning he was in his garden, and thought himself alone, but his sister was walking behind him, unseen by him:","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"85e7"}},
{"insert":"　　suddenly he paused and gazed at something on the ground; it was a large, black, hairy, frightful spider.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　His universal suavity was less an instinct of nature than the result of a grand conviction which had filtered into his heart through the medium of life, and had trickled there slowly, thought by thought; for, in a character, as in a rock, there may exist apertures made by drops of water.

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4557"}},
{"insert":"　　When he conversed with that infantile gayety which was one of his charms, and of which we have already spoken, people felt at their ease with him, and joy seemed to radiate from his whole person.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"d53e"}},
{"insert":"　　His fresh and ruddy complexion, his very white teeth, all of which he had preserved, and which were displayed by his smile, gave him that open and easy air which cause the remark to be made of a man, \"He's a good fellow\"; and of an old man, \"He is a fine man.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　On the first encounter, and to one who saw him for the first time, he was nothing, in fact, but a fine man.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"e2e2"}},
{"insert":"　　But if one remained near him for a few hours, and beheld him in the least degree pensive, the fine man became gradually transfigured, and took on some imposing quality, I know not what; his broad and serious brow, rendered august by his white locks, became august also by virtue of meditation; majesty radiated from his goodness, though his goodness ceased not to be radiant; one experienced something of the emotion which one would feel on beholding a smiling angel slowly unfold his wings, without ceasing to smile.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4980"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"fcee"}},
{"insert":"　　As we have seen, prayer, the celebration of the offices of religion, alms-giving, the consolation of the afflicted, the cultivation of a bit of land, fraternity, frugality, hospitality, renunciation, confidence, study, work, filled every day of his life.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"246b"}},
{"insert":"　　Filled is exactly the word; certainly the Bishop's day was quite full to the brim, of good words and good deeds.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5364"}},
{"insert":"　　Nevertheless, it was not complete if cold or rainy weather prevented his passing an hour or two in his garden before going to bed, and after the two women had retired. It seemed to be a sort of rite with him, to prepare himself for slumber by meditation in the presence of the grand spectacles of the nocturnal heavens.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　He was there alone, communing with himself, peaceful, adoring, comparing the serenity of his heart with the serenity of the ether, moved amid the darkness by the visible splendor of the constellations and the invisible splendor of God, opening his heart to the thoughts which fall from the Unknown. At such moments, while he offered his heart at the hour when nocturnal flowers offer their perfume, illuminated like a lamp amid the starry night, as he poured himself out in ecstasy in the midst of the universal radiance of creation, he could not have told himself, probably, what was passing in his spirit; he felt something take its flight from him, and something descend into him.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　He thought of the grandeur and presence of God; of the future eternity, that strange mystery; of the eternity past, a mystery still more strange; of all the infinities, which pierced their way into all his senses, beneath his eyes; and, without seeking to comprehend the incomprehensible, he gazed upon it.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　He seated himself on a wooden bench, with his back against a decrepit vine; he gazed at the stars, past the puny and stunted silhouettes of his fruit-trees.

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"bb56"}},
{"insert":"　　Since this sort of details might, particularly at the present moment, and to use an expression now in fashion, give to the Bishop of D---- a certain \"pantheistical\" physiognomy, and induce the belief, either to his credit or discredit, that he entertained one of those personal philosophies which are peculiar to our century, which sometimes spring up in solitary spirits, and there take on a form and grow until they usurp the place of religion, we insist upon it, that not one of those persons who knew Monseigneur Welcome would have thought himself authorized to think anything of the sort. That which enlightened this man was his heart.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　He would probably have felt a scruple at sounding too far in advance certain problems which are, in a manner, reserved for terrible great minds.

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"9594"}},
{"insert":"　　One might almost say, that by a sort of splendid reaction, it with it dazzles nature; the mysterious world which surrounds us renders back what it has received; it is probable that the contemplators are contemplated. ","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"2048"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"655f"}},
{"insert":"　　He did not attempt to impart to his chasuble the folds of Elijah's mantle; he projected no ray of future upon the dark groundswell of events; he did not see to condense in flame the light of things; he had nothing of the prophet and nothing of the magician about him.

{"insert":"　　That he carried prayer to the pitch of a superhuman aspiration is probable:","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　He inclined towards all that groans and all that expiates. The universe appeared to him like an immense malady; everywhere he felt fever, everywhere he heard the sound of suffering, and, without seeking to solve the enigma, he strove to dress the wound.

{"insert":"　　THE EVENING OF A DAY OF WALKING","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"f881"}},
{"insert":"　　Early in the month of October, 1815, about an hour before sunset, a man who was travelling on foot entered the little town of D---- The few inhabitants who were at their windows or on their thresholds at the moment stared at this traveller with a sort of uneasiness. It was difficult to encounter a wayfarer of more wretched appearance. He was a man of medium stature, thickset and robust, in the prime of life.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5421"}},
{"insert":"　　He might have been forty-six or forty-eight years old. A cap with a drooping leather visor partly concealed his face, burned and tanned by sun and wind, and dripping with perspiration. His shirt of coarse yellow linen, fastened at the neck by a small silver anchor, permitted a view of his hairy breast:","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"8794"}},
{"insert":"　　he had a cravat twisted into a string; trousers of blue drilling, worn and threadbare, white on one knee and torn on the other; an old gray, tattered blouse, patched on one of the elbows with a bit of green cloth sewed on with twine; a tightly packed soldier knapsack, well buckled and perfectly new, on his back; an enormous, knotty stick in his hand; iron-shod shoes on his stockingless feet; a shaved head and a long beard.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"632d"}},
{"insert":"　　The sweat, the heat, the journey on foot, the dust, added I know not what sordid quality to this dilapidated whole.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"dd0a"}},
{"insert":"　　His hair was closely cut, yet bristling, for it had begun to grow a little, and did not seem to have been cut for some time.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"cbbe"}},
{"insert":"　　No one knew him.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4cba"}},
{"insert":"　　He was evidently only a chance passer-by. Whence came he?","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"eba4"}},
{"insert":"　　From the south; from the seashore, perhaps, for he made his entrance into D---- by the same street which, seven months previously, had witnessed the passage of the Emperor Napoleon on his way from Cannes to Paris.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"644f"}},
{"insert":"　　This man must have been walking all day. He seemed very much fatigued.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"897f"}},
{"insert":"　　Some women of the ancient market town which is situated below the city had seen him pause beneath the trees of the boulevard Gassendi, and drink at the fountain which stands at the end of the promenade.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"553b"}},
{"insert":"　　He must have been very thirsty: for the children who followed him saw him stop again for a drink, two hundred paces further on, at the fountain in the market-place.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"b12a"}},
{"insert":"　　On arriving at the corner of the Rue Poichevert, he turned to the left, and directed his steps toward the town-hall. He entered, then came out a quarter of an hour later.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"8e8c"}},
{"insert":"　　A gendarme was seated near the door, on the stone bench which General Drouot had mounted on the 4th of March to read to the frightened throng of the inhabitants of D---- the proclamation of the Gulf Juan.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"61db"}},
{"insert":"　　The man pulled off his cap and humbly saluted the gendarme.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"69ee"}},
{"insert":"　　The gendarme, without replying to his salute, stared attentively at him, followed him for a while with his eyes, and then entered the town-hall.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"57c6"}},
{"insert":"　　There then existed at D---- a fine inn at the sign of the Cross of Colbas.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"bcbb"}},
{"insert":"　　This inn had for a landlord a certain Jacquin Labarre, a man of consideration in the town on account of his relationship to another Labarre, who kept the inn of the Three Dauphins in Grenoble, and had served in the Guides.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"f5e5"}},
{"insert":"　　At the time of the Emperor's landing, many rumors had circulated throughout the country with regard to this inn of the Three Dauphins.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"405d"}},
{"insert":"　　It was said that General Bertrand, disguised as a carter, had made frequent trips thither in the month of January, and that he had distributed crosses of honor to the soldiers and handfuls of gold to the citizens.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"1e94"}},
{"insert":"　　The truth is, that when the Emperor entered Grenoble he had refused to install himself at the hotel of the prefecture; he had thanked the mayor, saying, \"I am going to the house of a brave man of my acquaintance\"; and he had betaken himself to the Three Dauphins.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"bb91"}},
{"insert":"　　This glory of the Labarre of the Three Dauphins was reflected upon the Labarre of the Cross of Colbas, at a distance of five and twenty leagues. It was said of him in the town, \"That is the cousin of the man of Grenoble.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"b1ee"}},
{"insert":"　　The man bent his steps towards this inn, which was the best in the country-side. He entered the kitchen, which opened on a level with the street.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"846a"}},
{"insert":"　　All the stoves were lighted; a huge fire blazed gayly in the fireplace.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"bc72"}},
{"insert":"　　The host, who was also the chief cook, was going from one stew-pan to another, very busily superintending an excellent dinner designed for the wagoners, whose loud talking, conversation, and laughter were audible from an adjoining apartment. Any one who has travelled knows that there is no one who indulges in better cheer than wagoners.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4975"}},
{"insert":"　　A fat marmot, flanked by white partridges and heather-cocks, was turning on a long spit before the fire; on the stove, two huge carps from Lake Lauzet and a trout from Lake Alloz were cooking.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4c7e"}},
{"insert":"　　The host, hearing the door open and seeing a newcomer enter, said, without raising his eyes from his stoves:--","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"0733"}},
{"insert":"　　\"What do you wish, sir?\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3f72"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Food and lodging,\" said the man.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ceb4"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Nothing easier,\" replied the host.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"d6c8"}},
{"insert":"　　At that moment he turned his head, took in the traveller's appearance with a single glance, and added, \"By paying for it.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"f6a6"}},
{"insert":"　　The man drew a large leather purse from the pocket of his blouse, and answered, \"I have money.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"d11e"}},
{"insert":"　　\"In that case, we are at your service,\" said the host.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a8a7"}},
{"insert":"　　The man put his purse back in his pocket, removed his knapsack from his back, put it on the ground near the door, retained his stick in his hand, and seated himself on a low stool close to the fire. D---- is in the mountains.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"b2f8"}},
{"insert":"　　The evenings are cold there in October.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"f067"}},
{"insert":"　　But as the host went back and forth, he scrutinized the traveller.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4460"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Will dinner be ready soon?\" said the man.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"9fc6"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Immediately,\" replied the landlord.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"04d0"}},
{"insert":"　　While the newcomer was warming himself before the fire, with his back turned, the worthy host, Jacquin Labarre, drew a pencil from his pocket, then tore off the corner of an old newspaper which was lying on a small table near the window.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"c123"}},
{"insert":"　　On the white margin he wrote a line or two, folded it without sealing, and then intrusted this scrap of paper to a child who seemed to serve him in the capacity both of scullion and lackey.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"d311"}},
{"insert":"　　The landlord whispered a word in the scullion's ear, and the child set off on a run in the direction of the town-hall.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a6dc"}},
{"insert":"　　The traveller saw nothing of all this.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"c3c6"}},
{"insert":"　　Once more he inquired, \"Will dinner be ready soon?\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"9056"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Immediately,\" responded the host.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"d4eb"}},
{"insert":"　　The child returned.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"93a6"}},
{"insert":"　　He brought back the paper.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5163"}},
{"insert":"　　The host unfolded it eagerly, like a person who is expecting a reply.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"b1b7"}},
{"insert":"　　He seemed to read it attentively, then tossed his head, and remained thoughtful for a moment.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"42d7"}},
{"insert":"　　Then he took a step in the direction of the traveller, who appeared to be immersed in reflections which were not very serene.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"df01"}},
{"insert":"　　\"I cannot receive you, sir,\" said he.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3f1b"}},
{"insert":"　　The man half rose.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"8738"}},
{"insert":"　　\"What!","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"49fe"}},
{"insert":"　　Are you afraid that I will not pay you?","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4186"}},
{"insert":"　　Do you want me to pay you in advance?","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"11d7"}},
{"insert":"　　I have money, I tell you.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"0d2c"}},
{"insert":"　　\"It is not that.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"60ee"}},
{"insert":"　　\"What then?\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"18f3"}},
{"insert":"　　\"You have money--\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"2b66"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Yes,\" said the man.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"fd06"}},
{"insert":"　　\"And I,\" said the host, \"have no room.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"65a1"}},
{"insert":"　　The man resumed tranquilly, \"Put me in the stable.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"0067"}},
{"insert":"　　\"I cannot.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ad8f"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Why?\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"69c7"}},
{"insert":"　　\"The horses take up all the space.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"0737"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Very well!\" retorted the man; \"a corner of the loft then, a truss of straw.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"2d53"}},
{"insert":"　　We will see about that after dinner.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"e305"}},
{"insert":"　　\"I cannot give you any dinner.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"67c1"}},
{"insert":"　　This declaration, made in a measured but firm tone, struck the stranger as grave.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a69e"}},
{"insert":"　　He rose.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"c87f"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Ah! bah!","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3868"}},
{"insert":"　　But I am dying of hunger.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"1733"}},
{"insert":"　　I have been walking since sunrise. I have travelled twelve leagues.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"b6fe"}},
{"insert":"　　I pay.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"593d"}},
{"insert":"　　I wish to eat.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"e9cf"}},
{"insert":"　　\"I have nothing,\" said the landlord.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5125"}},
{"insert":"　　The man burst out laughing, and turned towards the fireplace and the stoves:","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"e08e"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Nothing! and all that?\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4b57"}},
{"insert":"　　\"All that is engaged.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"6349"}},
{"insert":"　　\"By whom?\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5c78"}},
{"insert":"　　\"By messieurs the wagoners.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"8180"}},
{"insert":"　　\"How many are there of them?\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"653b"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Twelve.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"40d9"}},
{"insert":"　　\"There is enough food there for twenty.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a45f"}},
{"insert":"　　\"They have engaged the whole of it and paid for it in advance.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"d8a9"}},
{"insert":"　　The man seated himself again, and said, without raising his voice, \"I am at an inn; I am hungry, and I shall remain.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3e98"}},
{"insert":"　　Then the host bent down to his ear, and said in a tone which made him start, \"Go away!\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"7a32"}},
{"insert":"　　At that moment the traveller was bending forward and thrusting some brands into the fire with the iron-shod tip of his staff; he turned quickly round, and as he opened his mouth to reply, the host gazed steadily at him and added, still in a low voice: \"Stop! there's enough of that sort of talk.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"1459"}},
{"insert":"　　Do you want me to tell you your name?","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"6c94"}},
{"insert":"　　Your name is Jean Valjean.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"cc4e"}},
{"insert":"　　Now do you want me to tell you who you are?","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"9271"}},
{"insert":"　　When I saw you come in I suspected something; I sent to the town-hall, and this was the reply that was sent to me. Can you read?\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4af1"}},
{"insert":"　　So saying, he held out to the stranger, fully unfolded, the paper which had just travelled from the inn to the town-hall, and from the town-hall to the inn.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"92f5"}},
{"insert":"　　The man cast a glance upon it. The landlord resumed after a pause.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"77e1"}},
{"insert":"　　\"I am in the habit of being polite to every one.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5700"}},
{"insert":"　　Go away!\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a62f"}},
{"insert":"　　The man dropped his head, picked up the knapsack which he had deposited on the ground, and took his departure.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"f886"}},
{"insert":"　　He chose the principal street.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"788f"}},
{"insert":"　　He walked straight on at a venture, keeping close to the houses like a sad and humiliated man. He did not turn round a single time.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"e835"}},
{"insert":"　　Had he done so, he would have seen the host of the Cross of Colbas standing on his threshold, surrounded by all the guests of his inn, and all the passers-by in the street, talking vivaciously, and pointing him out with his finger; and, from the glances of terror and distrust cast by the group, he might have divined that his arrival would speedily become an event for the whole town.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"6647"}},
{"insert":"　　He saw nothing of all this.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"983b"}},
{"insert":"　　People who are crushed do not look behind them.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"e043"}},
{"insert":"　　They know but too well the evil fate which follows them.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"b131"}},
{"insert":"　　Thus he proceeded for some time, walking on without ceasing, traversing at random streets of which he knew nothing, forgetful of his fatigue, as is often the case when a man is sad.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"beb2"}},
{"insert":"　　All at once he felt the pangs of hunger sharply.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"eed7"}},
{"insert":"　　Night was drawing near. He glanced about him, to see whether he could not discover some shelter.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"e488"}},
{"insert":"　　The fine hostelry was closed to him; he was seeking some very humble public house, some hovel, however lowly.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"59e3"}},
{"insert":"　　Just then a light flashed up at the end of the streets; a pine branch suspended from a cross-beam of iron was outlined against the white sky of the twilight.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"c627"}},
{"insert":"　　He proceeded thither.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"f6bf"}},
{"insert":"　　It proved to be, in fact, a public house.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"c754"}},
{"insert":"　　The public house which is in the Rue de Chaffaut.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4bcd"}},
{"insert":"　　The wayfarer halted for a moment, and peeped through the window into the interior of the low-studded room of the public house, illuminated by a small lamp on a table and by a large fire on the hearth.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"9510"}},
{"insert":"　　Some men were engaged in drinking there.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5de7"}},
{"insert":"　　The landlord was warming himself. An iron pot, suspended from a crane, bubbled over the flame.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"007f"}},
{"insert":"　　The entrance to this public house, which is also a sort of an inn, is by two doors.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"54f6"}},
{"insert":"　　One opens on the street, the other upon a small yard filled with manure.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5d31"}},
{"insert":"　　The traveller dare not enter by the street door. He slipped into the yard, halted again, then raised the latch timidly and opened the door.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"0716"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Who goes there?\" said the master.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"9c30"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Some one who wants supper and bed.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a571"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Good.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a129"}},
{"insert":"　　We furnish supper and bed here.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ea55"}},
{"insert":"　　He entered.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3f64"}},
{"insert":"　　All the men who were drinking turned round. The lamp illuminated him on one side, the firelight on the other. They examined him for some time while he was taking off his knapsack.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a023"}},
{"insert":"　　The host said to him, \"There is the fire.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"72f8"}},
{"insert":"　　The supper is cooking in the pot.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"f22d"}},
{"insert":"　　Come and warm yourself, comrade.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"026d"}},
{"insert":"　　He approached and seated himself near the hearth.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"9cc2"}},
{"insert":"　　He stretched out his feet, which were exhausted with fatigue, to the fire; a fine odor was emitted by the pot.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5b16"}},
{"insert":"　　All that could be distinguished of his face, beneath his cap, which was well pulled down, assumed a vague appearance of comfort, mingled with that other poignant aspect which habitual suffering bestows.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"7d12"}},
{"insert":"　　It was, moreover, a firm, energetic, and melancholy profile. This physiognomy was strangely composed; it began by seeming humble, and ended by seeming severe.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"9d3e"}},
{"insert":"　　The eye shone beneath its lashes like a fire beneath brushwood.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"e3bc"}},
{"insert":"　　One of the men seated at the table, however, was a fishmonger who, before entering the public house of the Rue de Chaffaut, had been to stable his horse at Labarre's. It chanced that he had that very morning encountered this unprepossessing stranger on the road between Bras d'Asse and--I have forgotten the name. I think it was Escoublon.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ca18"}},
{"insert":"　　Now, when he met him, the man, who then seemed already extremely weary, had requested him to take him on his crupper; to which the fishmonger had made no reply except by redoubling his gait.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"b193"}},
{"insert":"　　This fishmonger had been a member half an hour previously of the group which surrounded Jacquin Labarre, and had himself related his disagreeable encounter of the morning to the people at the Cross of Colbas.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"9e5b"}},
{"insert":"　　From where he sat he made an imperceptible sign to the tavern-keeper. The tavern-keeper went to him.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"86db"}},
{"insert":"　　They exchanged a few words in a low tone.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"741d"}},
{"insert":"　　The man had again become absorbed in his reflections.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"2c01"}},
{"insert":"　　The tavern-keeper returned to the fireplace, laid his hand abruptly on the shoulder of the man, and said to him:--","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5da0"}},
{"insert":"　　\"You are going to get out of here.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"00bd"}},
{"insert":"　　The stranger turned round and replied gently, \"Ah!","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"356b"}},
{"insert":"　　You know?--\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"23e5"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Yes.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"313d"}},
{"insert":"　　\"I was sent away from the other inn.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5d1c"}},

{"insert":"　　Night continued to fall.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"834c"}},
{"insert":"　　A cold wind from the Alps was blowing. By the light of the expiring day the stranger perceived, in one of the gardens which bordered the street, a sort of hut, which seemed to him to be built of sods.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4ab7"}},
{"insert":"　　He climbed over the wooden fence resolutely, and found himself in the garden.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"2bc0"}},
{"insert":"　　He approached the hut; its door consisted of a very low and narrow aperture, and it resembled those buildings which road-laborers construct for themselves along the roads.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"77f1"}},
{"insert":"　　He thought without doubt, that it was, in fact, the dwelling of a road-laborer; he was suffering from cold and hunger, but this was, at least, a shelter from the cold. This sort of dwelling is not usually occupied at night.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"d890"}},
{"insert":"　　He threw himself flat on his face, and crawled into the hut.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ff8e"}},
{"insert":"　　It was warm there, and he found a tolerably good bed of straw.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"0460"}},
{"insert":"　　He lay, for a moment, stretched out on this bed, without the power to make a movement, so fatigued was he.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"24e4"}},
{"insert":"　　Then, as the knapsack on his back was in his way, and as it furnished, moreover, a pillow ready to his hand, he set about unbuckling one of the straps.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"01f5"}},
{"insert":"　　At that moment, a ferocious growl became audible.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"dd4c"}},
{"insert":"　　He raised his eyes.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a562"}},
{"insert":"　　The head of an enormous dog was outlined in the darkness at the entrance of the hut.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"408b"}},
{"insert":"　　It was a dog's kennel.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"9153"}},
{"insert":"　　He was himself vigorous and formidable; he armed himself with his staff, made a shield of his knapsack, and made his way out of the kennel in the best way he could, not without enlarging the rents in his rags.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a31c"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"7c64"}},
{"insert":"　　When he had, not without difficulty, repassed the fence, and found himself once more in the street, alone, without refuge, without shelter, without a roof over his head, chased even from that bed of straw and from that miserable kennel, he dropped rather than seated himself on a stone, and it appears that a passer-by heard him exclaim, \"I am not even a dog!\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"9f16"}},
{"insert":"　　He soon rose again and resumed his march.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ad30"}},
{"insert":"　　He went out of the town, hoping to find some tree or haystack in the fields which would afford him shelter.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ad99"}},
{"insert":"　　He walked thus for some time, with his head still drooping. When he felt himself far from every human habitation, he raised his eyes and gazed searchingly about him.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a7bb"}},
{"insert":"　　He was in a field. Before him was one of those low hills covered with close-cut stubble, which, after the harvest, resemble shaved heads.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"d392"}},
{"insert":"　　The horizon was perfectly black.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"f1c1"}},
{"insert":"　　This was not alone the obscurity of night; it was caused by very low-hanging clouds which seemed to rest upon the hill itself, and which were mounting and filling the whole sky.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"cf96"}},
{"insert":"　　Meanwhile, as the moon was about to rise, and as there was still floating in the zenith a remnant of the brightness of twilight, these clouds formed at the summit of the sky a sort of whitish arch, whence a gleam of light fell upon the earth.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"d246"}},
{"insert":"　　The earth was thus better lighted than the sky, which produces a particularly sinister effect, and the hill, whose contour was poor and mean, was outlined vague and wan against the gloomy horizon.

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3a32"}},
{"insert":"　　There was nothing in the field or on the hill except a deformed tree, which writhed and shivered a few paces distant from the wayfarer.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ba22"}},
{"insert":"　　This man was evidently very far from having those delicate habits of intelligence and spirit which render one sensible to the mysterious aspects of things; nevertheless, there was something in that sky, in that hill, in that plain, in that tree, which was so profoundly desolate, that after a moment of immobility and revery he turned back abruptly.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"f9c6"}},
{"insert":"　　He passed through a breach and entered the town again.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　It might have been eight o'clock in the evening.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a242"}},
{"insert":"　　As he was not acquainted with the streets, he recommenced his walk at random.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ac6e"}},
{"insert":"　　In this way he came to the prefecture, then to the seminary. As he passed through the Cathedral Square, he shook his fist at the church.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"9f41"}},
{"insert":"　　At the corner of this square there is a printing establishment.

{"insert":"　　Madame Magloire small, plump, vivacious; Mademoiselle Baptistine gentle, slender, frail, somewhat taller than her brother, dressed in a gown of puce-colored silk, of the fashion of 1806, which she had purchased at that date in Paris, and which had lasted ever since.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　To borrow vulgar phrases, which possess the merit of giving utterance in a single word to an idea which a whole page would hardly suffice to express, Madame Magloire had the air of a peasant, and Mademoiselle Baptistine that of a lady. Madame Magloire wore a white quilted cap, a gold Jeannette cross on a velvet ribbon upon her neck, the only bit of feminine jewelry that there was in the house, a very white fichu puffing out from a gown of coarse black woollen stuff, with large, short sleeves, an apron of cotton cloth in red and green checks, knotted round the waist with a green ribbon, with a stomacher of the same attached by two pins at the upper corners, coarse shoes on her feet, and yellow stockings, like the women of Marseilles.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　Mademoiselle Baptistine's gown was cut on the patterns of 1806, with a short waist, a narrow, sheath-like skirt, puffed sleeves, with flaps and buttons. She concealed her gray hair under a frizzed wig known as the baby wig. Madame Magloire had an intelligent, vivacious, and kindly air; the two corners of her mouth unequally raised, and her upper lip, which was larger than the lower, imparted to her a rather crabbed and imperious look.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ca9b"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"6ae5"}},
{"insert":"　　The police was very badly organized, moreover, because there was no love lost between the Prefect and the Mayor, who sought to injure each other by making things happen.

{"insert":"　　\"Really!\" said the Bishop.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　This willingness to interrogate encouraged Madame Magloire; it seemed to her to indicate that the Bishop was on the point of becoming alarmed; she pursued triumphantly:--","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"0653"}},
{"insert":"　　the big barns which belong to the rich, and where there are forty or fifty cows which produce from seven to eight thousand cheeses each summer, and the associated fruitieres, which belong to the poor; these are the peasants of mid-mountain, who hold their cows in common, and share the proceeds. `They engage the services of a cheese-maker, whom they call the grurin; the grurin receives the milk of the associates three times a day, and marks the quantity on a double tally.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　Well, neither during supper, nor during the entire evening, did my brother utter a single word, with the exception of a few words about Jesus when he entered, which could remind the man of what he was, nor of what my brother was.

{"insert":"　　To such a point did he carry it, that at one time, when my brother was speaking of the mountaineers of Pontarlier, who exercise a gentle labor near heaven, and who, he added, are happy because they are innocent, he stopped short, fearing lest in this remark there might have escaped him something which might wound the man. By dint of reflection, I think I have comprehended what was passing in my brother's heart.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"7a73"}},
{"insert":"　　He was thinking, no doubt, that this man, whose name is Jean Valjean, had his misfortune only too vividly present in his mind; that the best thing was to divert him from it, and to make him believe, if only momentarily, that he was a person like any other, by treating him just in his ordinary way.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"61b8"}},
{"insert":"　　It has seemed to me that this might have been my brother's private thought. In any case, what I can say is that, if he entertained all these ideas, he gave no sign of them; from beginning to end, even to me he was the same as he is every evening, and he supped with this Jean Valjean with the same air and in the same manner in which he would have supped with M.

{"insert":"　　Jean Valjean was of that thoughtful but not gloomy disposition which constitutes the peculiarity of affectionate natures.

{"insert":"　　Thus his youth had been spent in rude and ill-paid toil.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　He returned at night weary, and ate his broth without uttering a word. His sister, mother Jeanne, often took the best part of his repast from his bowl while he was eating,--a bit of meat, a slice of bacon, the heart of the cabbage,--to give to one of her children. As he went on eating, with his head bent over the table and almost into his soup, his long hair falling about his bowl and concealing his eyes, he had the air of perceiving nothing and allowing it. There was at Faverolles, not far from the Valjean thatched cottage, on the other side of the lane, a farmer's wife named Marie-Claude; the Valjean children, habitually famished, sometimes went to borrow from Marie-Claude a pint of milk, in their mother's name, which they drank behind a hedge or in some alley corner, snatching the jug from each other so hastily that the little girls spilled it on their aprons and down their necks.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"0d89"}},

{"insert":"　　 When the hour came for him to take his departure from the galleys, when Jean Valjean heard in his ear the strange words, Thou art free! the moment seemed improbable and unprecedented; a ray of vivid light, a ray of the true light of the living, suddenly penetrated within him.

{"insert":"　　Jean Valjean had been dazzled by the idea of liberty.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　And this was encompassed with much bitterness.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"1804"}},
{"insert":"　　It is but just to add that he had forgotten to include in his calculations the forced repose of Sundays and festival days during nineteen years, which entailed a diminution of about eighty francs.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"542b"}},
{"insert":"　　At all events, his hoard had been reduced by various local levies to the sum of one hundred and nine francs fifteen sous, which had been counted out to him on his departure.

{"insert":"　　 As the Cathedral clock struck two in the morning, Jean Valjean awoke.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"de67"}},
{"insert":"　　What woke him was that his bed was too good.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"47c6"}},
{"insert":"　　It was nearly twenty years since he had slept in a bed, and, although he had not undressed, the sensation was too novel not to disturb his slumbers.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ac7a"}},
{"insert":"　　He had slept more than four hours.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"6cdd"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"bd0e"}},
{"insert":"　　He opened his eyes and stared into the gloom which surrounded him; then he closed them again, with the intention of going to sleep once more.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ea67"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"cdd4"}},
{"insert":"　　This is what happened to Jean Valjean.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"33bd"}},
{"insert":"　　He could not get to sleep again, and he fell to thinking.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"cbc8"}},
{"insert":"　　He was at one of those moments when the thoughts which one has in one's mind are troubled.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"499a"}},
{"insert":"　　There was a sort of dark confusion in his brain. His memories of the olden time and of the immediate present floated there pell-mell and mingled confusedly, losing their proper forms, becoming disproportionately large, then suddenly disappearing, as in a muddy and perturbed pool.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4270"}},
{"insert":"　　Many thoughts occurred to him; but there was one which kept constantly presenting itself afresh, and which drove away all others.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a555"}},
{"insert":"　　We will mention this thought at once: he had observed the six sets of silver forks and spoons and the ladle which Madame Magloire had placed on the table.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"998b"}},
{"insert":"　　Those six sets of silver haunted him.--They were there.--A few paces distant.--Just as he was traversing the adjoining room to reach the one in which he then was, the old servant-woman had been in the act of placing them in a little cupboard near the head of the bed.-- He had taken careful note of this cupboard.--On the right, as you entered from the dining-room.--They were solid.--And old silver.-- From the ladle one could get at least two hundred francs.-- Double what he had earned in nineteen years.--It is true that he would have earned more if \"the administration had not robbed him.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"902b"}},
{"insert":"　　His mind wavered for a whole hour in fluctuations with which there was certainly mingled some struggle.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"7c2b"}},
{"insert":"　　Three o'clock struck.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ed8a"}},
{"insert":"　　He opened his eyes again, drew himself up abruptly into a sitting posture, stretched out his arm and felt of his knapsack, which he had thrown down on a corner of the alcove; then he hung his legs over the edge of the bed, and placed his feet on the floor, and thus found himself, almost without knowing it, seated on his bed.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"92bc"}},
{"insert":"　　He remained for a time thoughtfully in this attitude, which would have been suggestive of something sinister for any one who had seen him thus in the dark, the only person awake in that house where all were sleeping.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5b76"}},
{"insert":"　　All of a sudden he stooped down, removed his shoes and placed them softly on the mat beside the bed; then he resumed his thoughtful attitude, and became motionless once more.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"b052"}},
{"insert":"　　Throughout this hideous meditation, the thoughts which we have above indicated moved incessantly through his brain; entered, withdrew, re-entered, and in a manner oppressed him; and then he thought, also, without knowing why, and with the mechanical persistence of revery, of a convict named Brevet, whom he had known in the galleys, and whose trousers had been upheld by a single suspender of knitted cotton. The checkered pattern of that suspender recurred incessantly to his mind.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"bcdd"}},
{"insert":"　　He remained in this situation, and would have so remained indefinitely, even until daybreak, had not the clock struck one--the half or quarter hour.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"94d9"}},
{"insert":"　　It seemed to him that that stroke said to him, \"Come on!\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"f3ce"}},
{"insert":"　　He rose to his feet, hesitated still another moment, and listened; all was quiet in the house; then he walked straight ahead, with short steps, to the window, of which he caught a glimpse. The night was not very dark; there was a full moon, across which coursed large clouds driven by the wind.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5539"}},
{"insert":"　　This created, outdoors, alternate shadow and gleams of light, eclipses, then bright openings of the clouds; and indoors a sort of twilight.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"b0a1"}},
{"insert":"　　This twilight, sufficient to enable a person to see his way, intermittent on account of the clouds, resembled the sort of livid light which falls through an air-hole in a cellar, before which the passersby come and go.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"0667"}},
{"insert":"　　On arriving at the window, Jean Valjean examined it. It had no grating; it opened in the garden and was fastened, according to the fashion of the country, only by a small pin. He opened it; but as a rush of cold and piercing air penetrated the room abruptly, he closed it again immediately.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"88c5"}},
{"insert":"　　He scrutinized the garden with that attentive gaze which studies rather than looks. The garden was enclosed by a tolerably low white wall, easy to climb. Far away, at the extremity, he perceived tops of trees, spaced at regular intervals, which indicated that the wall separated the garden from an avenue or lane planted with trees.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"7d32"}},
{"insert":"　　Having taken this survey, he executed a movement like that of a man who has made up his mind, strode to his alcove, grasped his knapsack, opened it, fumbled in it, pulled out of it something which he placed on the bed, put his shoes into one of his pockets, shut the whole thing up again, threw the knapsack on his shoulders, put on his cap, drew the visor down over his eyes, felt for his cudgel, went and placed it in the angle of the window; then returned to the bed, and resolutely seized the object which he had deposited there. It resembled a short bar of iron, pointed like a pike at one end. It would have been difficult to distinguish in that darkness for what employment that bit of iron could have been designed. Perhaps it was a lever; possibly it was a club.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4477"}},
{"insert":"　　In the daytime it would have been possible to recognize it as nothing more than a miner's candlestick.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"86f0"}},
{"insert":"　　Convicts were, at that period, sometimes employed in quarrying stone from the lofty hills which environ Toulon, and it was not rare for them to have miners' tools at their command.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"daff"}},
{"insert":"　　These miners' candlesticks are of massive iron, terminated at the lower extremity by a point, by means of which they are stuck into the rock.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"b683"}},
{"insert":"　　He took the candlestick in his right hand; holding his breath and trying to deaden the sound of his tread, he directed his steps to the door of the adjoining room, occupied by the Bishop, as we already know.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ed04"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"81d9"}},
{"insert":"　　Not a sound.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"c9ac"}},
{"insert":"　　He gave the door a push.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"6e80"}},
{"insert":"　　He pushed it gently with the tip of his finger, lightly, with the furtive and uneasy gentleness of a cat which is desirous of entering.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"1d26"}},
{"insert":"　　The door yielded to this pressure, and made an imperceptible and silent movement, which enlarged the opening a little.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"7438"}},
{"insert":"　　He waited a moment; then gave the door a second and a bolder push.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"0fe7"}},
{"insert":"　　It continued to yield in silence.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"99a8"}},
{"insert":"　　The opening was now large enough to allow him to pass.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"91c5"}},
{"insert":"　　But near the door there stood a little table, which formed an embarrassing angle with it, and barred the entrance.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"6fda"}},
{"insert":"　　Jean Valjean recognized the difficulty.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"9661"}},
{"insert":"　　It was necessary, at any cost, to enlarge the aperture still further.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"1be7"}},
{"insert":"　　He decided on his course of action, and gave the door a third push, more energetic than the two preceding.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"0966"}},
{"insert":"　　This time a badly oiled hinge suddenly emitted amid the silence a hoarse and prolonged cry.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"69a8"}},
{"insert":"　　Jean Valjean shuddered.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"d202"}},
{"insert":"　　The noise of the hinge rang in his ears with something of the piercing and formidable sound of the trump of the Day of Judgment.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"2b4a"}},
{"insert":"　　In the fantastic exaggerations of the first moment he almost imagined that that hinge had just become animated, and had suddenly assumed a terrible life, and that it was barking like a dog to arouse every one, and warn and to wake those who were asleep.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"b437"}},
{"insert":"　　He halted, shuddering, bewildered, and fell back from the tips of his toes upon his heels. He heard the arteries in his temples beating like two forge hammers, and it seemed to him that his breath issued from his breast with the roar of the wind issuing from a cavern.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"6960"}},
{"insert":"　　It seemed impossible to him that the horrible clamor of that irritated hinge should not have disturbed the entire household, like the shock of an earthquake; the door, pushed by him, had taken the alarm, and had shouted; the old man would rise at once; the two old women would shriek out; people would come to their assistance; in less than a quarter of an hour the town would be in an uproar, and the gendarmerie on hand. For a moment he thought himself lost.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"cc90"}},
{"insert":"　　He remained where he was, petrified like the statue of salt, not daring to make a movement.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"57d8"}},
{"insert":"　　Several minutes elapsed.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5216"}},
{"insert":"　　The door had fallen wide open.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"dc7a"}},
{"insert":"　　He ventured to peep into the next room. Nothing had stirred there.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　This first danger was past; but there still reigned a frightful tumult within him.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　Even when he had thought himself lost, he had not drawn back.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"57c8"}},
{"insert":"　　His only thought now was to finish as soon as possible.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"c928"}},
{"insert":"　　He took a step and entered the room.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"7678"}},
{"insert":"　　This room was in a state of perfect calm.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"6a81"}},
{"insert":"　　Here and there vague and confused forms were distinguishable, which in the daylight were papers scattered on a table, open folios, volumes piled upon a stool, an arm-chair heaped with clothing, a prie-Dieu, and which at that hour were only shadowy corners and whitish spots.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"d9b5"}},

{"insert":"　　For the last half-hour a large cloud had covered the heavens.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5dd5"}},
{"insert":"　　At the moment when Jean Valjean paused in front of the bed, this cloud parted, as though on purpose, and a ray of light, traversing the long window, suddenly illuminated the Bishop's pale face.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"b08f"}},
{"insert":"　　He was sleeping peacefully.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"97ac"}},
{"insert":"　　He lay in his bed almost completely dressed, on account of the cold of the Basses-Alps, in a garment of brown wool, which covered his arms to the wrists.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a3d2"}},
{"insert":"　　His head was thrown back on the pillow, in the careless attitude of repose; his hand, adorned with the pastoral ring, and whence had fallen so many good deeds and so many holy actions, was hanging over the edge of the bed.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"7aa6"}},
{"insert":"　　His whole face was illumined with a vague expression of satisfaction, of hope, and of felicity. It was more than a smile, and almost a radiance.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4365"}},
{"insert":"　　He bore upon his brow the indescribable reflection of a light which was invisible. The soul of the just contemplates in sleep a mysterious heaven.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"0003"}},
{"insert":"　　A reflection of that heaven rested on the Bishop.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　It was, at the same time, a luminous transparency, for that heaven was within him.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"76b5"}},
{"insert":"　　At the moment when the ray of moonlight superposed itself, so to speak, upon that inward radiance, the sleeping Bishop seemed as in a glory. It remained, however, gentle and veiled in an ineffable half-light. That moon in the sky, that slumbering nature, that garden without a quiver, that house which was so calm, the hour, the moment, the silence, added some solemn and unspeakable quality to the venerable repose of this man, and enveloped in a sort of serene and majestic aureole that white hair, those closed eyes, that face in which all was hope and all was confidence, that head of an old man, and that slumber of an infant.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　This confidence terrified him. The moral world has no grander spectacle than this:","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　No one could have told what was passing within him, not even himself.

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"fb50"}},
{"insert":"　　The only thing which was clearly to be inferred from his attitude and his physiognomy was a strange indecision.

{"insert":"　　Well, but how is this?","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"0318"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"1bb5"}},
{"insert":"　　The gendarmes released Jean Valjean, who recoiled.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"9a3e"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Is it true that I am to be released?\" he said, in an almost inarticulate voice, and as though he were talking in his sleep.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　Jean Valjean was trembling in every limb.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　He wandered thus the whole morning, without having eaten anything and without feeling hungry. He was the prey of a throng of novel sensations.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"270e"}},
{"insert":"　　He was conscious of a sort of rage; he did not know against whom it was directed. He could not have told whether he was touched or humiliated.

{"insert":"　　He perceived with dismay that the sort of frightful calm which the injustice of his misfortune had conferred upon him was giving way within him. He asked himself what would replace this.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ef9d"}},
{"insert":"　　At times he would have actually preferred to be in prison with the gendarmes, and that things should not have happened in this way; it would have agitated him less. Although the season was tolerably far advanced, there were still a few late flowers in the hedge-rows here and there, whose odor as he passed through them in his march recalled to him memories of his childhood.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　As the sun declined to its setting, casting long shadows athwart the soil from every pebble, Jean Valjean sat down behind a bush upon a large ruddy plain, which was absolutely deserted.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　In the middle of this meditation, which would have contributed not a little to render his rags terrifying to any one who might have encountered him, a joyous sound became audible.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"d30a"}},
{"insert":"　　He turned his head and saw a little Savoyard, about ten years of age, coming up the path and singing, his hurdy-gurdy on his hip, and his marmot-box on his back,","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"0663"}},
{"insert":"　　One of those gay and gentle children, who go from land to land affording a view of their knees through the holes in their trousers.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　Without stopping his song, the lad halted in his march from time to time, and played at knuckle-bones with some coins which he had in his hand--his whole fortune, probably.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3c18"}},
{"insert":"　　Among this money there was one forty-sou piece.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"e18e"}},
{"insert":"　　The child halted beside the bush, without perceiving Jean Valjean, and tossed up his handful of sous, which, up to that time, he had caught with a good deal of adroitness on the back of his hand.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　It was as though he had received a galvanic shock. \"What is this?\" he muttered between his teeth.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　He was encompassed by space. There was nothing around him but an obscurity in which his gaze was lost, and a silence which engulfed his voice.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　An icy north wind was blowing, and imparted to things around him a sort of lugubrious life.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"9236"}},
{"insert":"　　He set out on his march again, then he began to run; and from time to time he halted and shouted into that solitude, with a voice which was the most formidable and the most disconsolate that it was possible to hear, \"Little Gervais!","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"82eb"}},
{"insert":"　　Little Gervais!\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"d038"}},
{"insert":"　　But the child was no doubt already far away.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ecf1"}},
{"insert":"　　He encountered a priest on horseback.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3a43"}},
{"insert":"　　He stepped up to him and said:--","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"2957"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Monsieur le Cure, have you seen a child pass?\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"846b"}},

{"insert":"　　\"I have seen no one.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"d83e"}},
{"insert":"　　He drew two five-franc pieces from his money-bag and handed them to the priest.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"116b"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Monsieur le Cure, this is for your poor people.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5fd8"}},
{"insert":"　　Monsieur le Cure, he was a little lad, about ten years old, with a marmot, I think, and a hurdy-gurdy. One of those Savoyards, you know?\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"011c"}},
{"insert":"　　\"I have not seen him.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"b4a6"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Little Gervais?","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　There are no villages here?","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　Can you tell me?\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5a34"}},
{"insert":"　　We know nothing of them.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a569"}},
{"insert":"　　Jean Valjean seized two more coins of five francs each with violence, and gave them to the priest.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"61a0"}},
{"insert":"　　\"For your poor,\" he said.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"b7e0"}},
{"insert":"　　Then he added, wildly:--","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"95e4"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Monsieur l'Abbe, have me arrested.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4d4c"}},
{"insert":"　　I am a thief.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"9e04"}},
{"insert":"　　The priest put spurs to his horse and fled in haste, much alarmed.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"9765"}},
{"insert":"　　Jean Valjean set out on a run, in the direction which he had first taken.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"d17f"}},
{"insert":"　　In this way he traversed a tolerably long distance, gazing, calling, shouting, but he met no one.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"51c1"}},
{"insert":"　　Two or three times he ran across the plain towards something which conveyed to him the effect of a human being reclining or crouching down; it turned out to be nothing but brushwood or rocks nearly on a level with the earth. At length, at a spot where three paths intersected each other, he stopped.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"6914"}},
{"insert":"　　The moon had risen.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ef94"}},
{"insert":"　　He sent his gaze into the distance and shouted for the last time, \"Little Gervais!","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3880"}},
{"insert":"　　Little Gervais! Little Gervais!\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"0bf4"}},
{"insert":"　　His shout died away in the mist, without even awakening an echo.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"f3ec"}},
{"insert":"　　He murmured yet once more, \"Little Gervais!\" but in a feeble and almost inarticulate voice.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"cb3a"}},
{"insert":"　　It was his last effort; his legs gave way abruptly under him, as though an invisible power had suddenly overwhelmed him with the weight of his evil conscience; he fell exhausted, on a large stone, his fists clenched in his hair and his face on his knees, and he cried, \"I am a wretch!\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4791"}},
{"insert":"　　Then his heart burst, and he began to cry.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a53c"}},
{"insert":"　　It was the first time that he had wept in nineteen years.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"db94"}},
{"insert":"　　When Jean Valjean left the Bishop's house, he was, as we have seen, quite thrown out of everything that had been his thought hitherto. He could not yield to the evidence of what was going on within him. He hardened himself against the angelic action and the gentle words of the old man.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"dbaf"}},
{"insert":"　　\"You have promised me to become an honest man. I buy your soul.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"e875"}},
{"insert":"　　I take it away from the spirit of perversity; I give it to the good God.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"d859"}},
{"insert":"　　This recurred to his mind unceasingly.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"6942"}},
{"insert":"　　To this celestial kindness he opposed pride, which is the fortress of evil within us. He was indistinctly conscious that the pardon of this priest was the greatest assault and the most formidable attack which had moved him yet; that his obduracy was finally settled if he resisted this clemency; that if he yielded, he should be obliged to renounce that hatred with which the actions of other men had filled his soul through so many years, and which pleased him; that this time it was necessary to conquer or to be conquered; and that a struggle, a colossal and final struggle, had been begun between his viciousness and the goodness of that man.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"9458"}},
{"insert":"　　In the presence of these lights, he proceeded like a man who is intoxicated.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a32c"}},
{"insert":"　　As he walked thus with haggard eyes, did he have a distinct perception of what might result to him from his adventure at D----? Did he understand all those mysterious murmurs which warn or importune the spirit at certain moments of life? Did a voice whisper in his ear that he had just passed the solemn hour of his destiny; that there no longer remained a middle course for him; that if he were not henceforth the best of men, he would be the worst; that it behooved him now, so to speak, to mount higher than the Bishop, or fall lower than the convict; that if he wished to become good be must become an angel; that if he wished to remain evil, he must become a monster?","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"fa10"}},
{"insert":"　　Here, again, some questions must be put, which we have already put to ourselves elsewhere:","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ae5a"}},
{"insert":"　　did he catch some shadow of all this in his thought, in a confused way?","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"6068"}},
{"insert":"　　Misfortune certainly, as we have said, does form the education of the intelligence; nevertheless, it is doubtful whether Jean Valjean was in a condition to disentangle all that we have here indicated.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"9653"}},
{"insert":"　　If these ideas occurred to him, he but caught glimpses of, rather than saw them, and they only succeeded in throwing him into an unutterable and almost painful state of emotion.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"277e"}},
{"insert":"　　On emerging from that black and deformed thing which is called the galleys, the Bishop had hurt his soul, as too vivid a light would have hurt his eyes on emerging from the dark.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"eb6e"}},
{"insert":"　　The future life, the possible life which offered itself to him henceforth, all pure and radiant, filled him with tremors and anxiety.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"7a2f"}},
{"insert":"　　He no longer knew where he really was.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4154"}},
{"insert":"　　Like an owl, who should suddenly see the sun rise, the convict had been dazzled and blinded, as it were, by virtue.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a603"}},
{"insert":"　　That which was certain, that which he did not doubt, was that he was no longer the same man, that everything about him was changed, that it was no longer in his power to make it as though the Bishop had not spoken to him and had not touched him.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"f07e"}},
{"insert":"　　In this state of mind he had encountered little Gervais, and had robbed him of his forty sous.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4416"}},
{"insert":"　　Why?","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"377e"}},
{"insert":"　　He certainly could not have explained it; was this the last effect and the supreme effort, as it were, of the evil thoughts which he had brought away from the galleys,-- a remnant of impulse, a result of what is called in statics, acquired force?","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"b9df"}},
{"insert":"　　It was that, and it was also, perhaps, even less than that.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"0005"}},
{"insert":"　　Let us say it simply, it was not he who stole; it was not the man; it was the beast, who, by habit and instinct, had simply placed his foot upon that money, while the intelligence was struggling amid so many novel and hitherto unheard-of thoughts besetting it.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"9aeb"}},
{"insert":"　　When intelligence re-awakened and beheld that action of the brute, Jean Valjean recoiled with anguish and uttered a cry of terror.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"635a"}},
{"insert":"　　It was because,--strange phenomenon, and one which was possible only in the situation in which he found himself,--in stealing the money from that child, he had done a thing of which he was no longer capable.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"608e"}},
{"insert":"　　However that may be, this last evil action had a decisive effect on him; it abruptly traversed that chaos which he bore in his mind, and dispersed it, placed on one side the thick obscurity, and on the other the light, and acted on his soul, in the state in which it then was, as certain chemical reagents act upon a troubled mixture by precipitating one element and clarifying the other.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"9838"}},
{"insert":"　　First of all, even before examining himself and reflecting, all bewildered, like one who seeks to save himself, he tried to find the child in order to return his money to him; then, when he recognized the fact that this was impossible, he halted in despair. At the moment when he exclaimed \"I am a wretch!\" he had just perceived what he was, and he was already separated from himself to such a degree, that he seemed to himself to be no longer anything more than a phantom, and as if he had, there before him, in flesh and blood, the hideous galley-convict, Jean Valjean, cudgel in hand, his blouse on his hips, his knapsack filled with stolen objects on his back, with his resolute and gloomy visage, with his thoughts filled with abominable projects.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"8c25"}},
{"insert":"　　Excess of unhappiness had, as we have remarked, made him in some sort a visionary.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a494"}},
{"insert":"　　This, then, was in the nature of a vision. He actually saw that Jean Valjean, that sinister face, before him. He had almost reached the point of asking himself who that man was, and he was horrified by him.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"aee8"}},
{"insert":"　　His brain was going through one of those violent and yet perfectly calm moments in which revery is so profound that it absorbs reality. One no longer beholds the object which one has before one, and one sees, as though apart from one's self, the figures which one has in one's own mind.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5148"}},
{"insert":"　　Thus he contemplated himself, so to speak, face to face, and at the same time, athwart this hallucination, he perceived in a mysterious depth a sort of light which he at first took for a torch.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3f05"}},
{"insert":"　　On scrutinizing this light which appeared to his conscience with more attention, he recognized the fact that it possessed a human form and that this torch was the Bishop.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"9df9"}},
{"insert":"　　His conscience weighed in turn these two men thus placed before it,-- the Bishop and Jean Valjean.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"f2d5"}},
{"insert":"　　Nothing less than the first was required to soften the second.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5431"}},
{"insert":"　　By one of those singular effects, which are peculiar to this sort of ecstasies, in proportion as his revery continued, as the Bishop grew great and resplendent in his eyes, so did Jean Valjean grow less and vanish.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"c9e4"}},
{"insert":"　　After a certain time he was no longer anything more than a shade.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"fee2"}},
{"insert":"　　All at once he disappeared. The Bishop alone remained; he filled the whole soul of this wretched man with a magnificent radiance.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"47fc"}},
{"insert":"　　Jean Valjean wept for a long time.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"fad7"}},
{"insert":"　　He wept burning tears, he sobbed with more weakness than a woman, with more fright than a child.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5b46"}},
{"insert":"　　As he wept, daylight penetrated more and more clearly into his soul; an extraordinary light; a light at once ravishing and terrible. His past life, his first fault, his long expiation, his external brutishness, his internal hardness, his dismissal to liberty, rejoicing in manifold plans of vengeance, what had happened to him at the Bishop's, the last thing that he had done, that theft of forty sous from a child, a crime all the more cowardly, and all the more monstrous since it had come after the Bishop's pardon,--all this recurred to his mind and appeared clearly to him, but with a clearness which he had never hitherto witnessed.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ba63"}},
{"insert":"　　He examined his life, and it seemed horrible to him; his soul, and it seemed frightful to him. In the meantime a gentle light rested over this life and this soul. It seemed to him that he beheld Satan by the light of Paradise.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　Let us say at once that that merry obstacle, a shower, was lacking in the case of this good-humored party, although Favourite had said as they set out, with a magisterial and maternal tone, \"The slugs are crawling in the paths,--a sign of rain, children.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　A good old classic poet, then famous, a good fellow who had an Eleonore, M. le Chevalier de Labouisse, as he strolled that day beneath the chestnut-trees of Saint-Cloud, saw them pass about ten o'clock in the morning, and exclaimed, \"There is one too many of them,\" as he thought of the Graces.Favourite, Blachevelle's friend, the one aged three and twenty, the old one, ran on in front under the great green boughs, jumped the ditches, stalked distractedly over bushes, and presided over this merry-making with the spirit of a young female faun.Zephine and Dahlia, whom chance had made beautiful in such a way that they set each off when they were together, and completed each other, never left each other, more from an instinct of coquetry than from friendship, and clinging to each other, they assumed English poses; the first keepsakes had just made their appearance, melancholy was dawning for women, as later on, Byronism dawned for men; and the hair of the tender sex began to droop dolefully.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　He was very gay, but one felt the force of government in him; there was dictation in his joviality; his principal ornament was a pair of trousers of elephant-leg pattern of nankeen, with straps of braided copper wire; he carried a stout rattan worth two hundred francs in his hand, and, as he treated himself to everything, a strange thing called a cigar in his mouth.Nothing was sacred to him; he smoked.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　Her rosy lips babbled enchantingly.The corners of her mouth voluptuously turned up, as in the antique masks of Erigone, had an air of encouraging the audacious; but her long, shadowy lashes drooped discreetly over the jollity of the lower part of the face as though to call a halt.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"b3f9"}},
{"insert":"　　There was something indescribably harmonious and striking about her entire dress.She wore a gown of mauve barege, little reddish brown buskins, whose ribbons traced an X on her fine, white, open-worked stockings, and that sort of muslin spencer, a Marseilles invention, whose name, canezou, a corruption of the words quinze aout, pronounced after the fashion of the Canebiere, signifies fine weather, heat, and midday.The three others, less timid, as we have already said, wore low-necked dresses without disguise, which in summer, beneath flower-adorned hats, are very graceful and enticing; but by the side of these audacious outfits, blond Fantine's canezou, with its transparencies, its indiscretion, and its reticence, concealing and displaying at one and the same time, seemed an alluring godsend of decency, and the famous Court of Love, presided over by the Vicomtesse de Cette, with the sea-green eyes, would, perhaps, have awarded the prize for coquetry to this canezou, in the contest for the prize of modesty.The most ingenious is, at times, the wisest.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　Brilliant of face, delicate of profile, with eyes of a deep blue, heavy lids, feet arched and small, wrists and ankles admirably formed, a white skin which, here and there allowed the azure branching of the veins to be seen, joy, a cheek that was young and fresh, the robust throat of the Juno of AEgina, a strong and supple nape of the neck, shoulders modelled as though by Coustou, with a voluptuous dimple in the middle, visible through the muslin; a gayety cooled by dreaminess; sculptural and exquisite--such was Fantine; and beneath these feminine adornments and these ribbons one could divine a statue, and in that statue a soul.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"9b96"}},
{"insert":"　　To an observer who studied her attentively, that which breathed from her athwart all the intoxication of her age, the season, and her love affair, was an invincible expression of reserve and modesty.She remained a little astonished.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"0140"}},
{"insert":"　　This chaste astonishment is the shade of difference which separates Psyche from Venus.Fantine had the long, white, fine fingers of the vestal virgin who stirs the ashes of the sacred fire with a golden pin.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"459c"}},
{"insert":"　　Although she would have refused nothing to Tholomyes, as we shall have more than ample opportunity to see, her face in repose was supremely virginal; a sort of serious and almost austere dignity suddenly overwhelmed her at certain times, and there was nothing more singular and disturbing than to see gayety become so suddenly extinct there, and meditation succeed to cheerfulness without any transition state.This sudden and sometimes severely accentuated gravity resembled the disdain of a goddess.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"d60f"}},
{"insert":"　　Her brow, her nose, her chin, presented that equilibrium of outline which is quite distinct from equilibrium of proportion, and from which harmony of countenance results; in the very characteristic interval which separates the base of the nose from the upper lip, she had that imperceptible and charming fold, a mysterious sign of chastity, which makes Barberousse fall in love with a Diana found in the treasures of Iconia.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"6bdd"}},
{"insert":"　　Who were these Thenardiers?","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"0546"}},
{"insert":"　　Let us say a word or two of them now.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"11f1"}},
{"insert":"　　We will complete the sketch later on.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"8f9c"}},
{"insert":"　　These beings belonged to that bastard class composed of coarse people who have been successful, and of intelligent people who have descended in the scale, which is between the class called \"middle\" and the class denominated as \"inferior,\" and which combines some of the defects of the second with nearly all the vices of the first, without possessing the generous impulse of the workingman nor the honest order of the bourgeois.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"2cf4"}},
{"insert":"　　They were of those dwarfed natures which, if a dull fire chances to warm them up, easily become monstrous.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"458a"}},
{"insert":"　　There was in the woman a substratum of the brute, and in the man the material for a blackguard. Both were susceptible, in the highest degree, of the sort of hideous progress which is accomplished in the direction of evil.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"d5e3"}},
{"insert":"　　There exist crab-like souls which are continually retreating towards the darkness, retrograding in life rather than advancing, employing experience to augment their deformity, growing incessantly worse, and becoming more and more impregnated with an ever-augmenting blackness. This man and woman possessed such souls.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"15b2"}},
{"insert":"　　Thenardier, in particular, was troublesome for a physiognomist. One can only look at some men to distrust them; for one feels that they are dark in both directions.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"e6bf"}},
{"insert":"　　They are uneasy in the rear and threatening in front.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"18a3"}},
{"insert":"　　There is something of the unknown about them. One can no more answer for what they have done than for what they will do.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"f880"}},
{"insert":"　　The shadow which they bear in their glance denounces them. From merely hearing them utter a word or seeing them make a gesture, one obtains a glimpse of sombre secrets in their past and of sombre mysteries in their future.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"189b"}},
{"insert":"　　This Thenardier, if he himself was to be believed, had been a soldier-- a sergeant, he said.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"251b"}},
{"insert":"　　He had probably been through the campaign of 1815, and had even conducted himself with tolerable valor, it would seem. We shall see later on how much truth there was in this.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"8bbd"}},
{"insert":"　　The sign of his hostelry was in allusion to one of his feats of arms. He had painted it himself; for he knew how to do a little of everything, and badly.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a9c6"}},
{"insert":"　　It was at the epoch when the ancient classical romance which, after having been Clelie, was no longer anything but Lodoiska, still noble, but ever more and more vulgar, having fallen from Mademoiselle de Scuderi to Madame Bournon-Malarme, and from Madame de Lafayette to Madame Barthelemy-Hadot, was setting the loving hearts of the portresses of Paris aflame, and even ravaging the suburbs to some extent. Madame Thenardier was just intelligent enough to read this sort of books. She lived on them.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"6fc3"}},
{"insert":"　　In them she drowned what brains she possessed. This had given her, when very young, and even a little later, a sort of pensive attitude towards her husband, a scamp of a certain depth, a ruffian lettered to the extent of the grammar, coarse and fine at one and the same time, but, so far as sentimentalism was concerned, given to the perusal of Pigault-Lebrun, and \"in what concerns the sex,\" as he said in his jargon--a downright, unmitigated lout.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"812d"}},
{"insert":"　　His wife was twelve or fifteen years younger than he was.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5c3d"}},
{"insert":"　　Later on, when her hair, arranged in a romantically drooping fashion, began to grow gray, when the Magaera began to be developed from the Pamela, the female Thenardier was nothing but a coarse, vicious woman, who had dabbled in stupid romances.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"357c"}},
{"insert":"　　Now, one cannot read nonsense with impunity. The result was that her eldest daughter was named Eponine; as for the younger, the poor little thing came near being called Gulnare; I know not to what diversion, effected by a romance of Ducray-Dumenil, she owed the fact that she merely bore the name of Azelma.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"8164"}},
{"insert":"　　However, we will remark by the way, everything was not ridiculous and superficial in that curious epoch to which we are alluding, and which may be designated as the anarchy of baptismal names. By the side of this romantic element which we have just indicated there is the social symptom.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"7082"}},
{"insert":"　　It is not rare for the neatherd's boy nowadays to bear the name of Arthur, Alfred, or Alphonse, and for the vicomte--if there are still any vicomtes--to be called Thomas, Pierre, or Jacques.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"2a94"}},

{"insert":"　　The woman took Cosette's outfit to Paris, and pawned it at the pawnbroker's for sixty francs.

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"c675"}},
{"insert":"　　As she had no longer any clothes, they dressed her in the cast-off petticoats and chemises of the Thenardier brats; that is to say, in rags. They fed her on what all the rest had left--a little better than the dog, a little worse than the cat.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"440f"}},
{"insert":"　　Moreover, the cat and the dog were her habitual table-companions; Cosette ate with them under the table, from a wooden bowl similar to theirs.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5975"}},
{"insert":"　　The mother, who had established herself, as we shall see later on, at M. sur M., wrote, or, more correctly, caused to be written, a letter every month, that she might have news of her child. The Thenardiers replied invariably, \"Cosette is doing wonderfully well.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　The mother, whom they had persuaded into the belief that her child was happy, \"and was coming on well,\" submitted, and forwarded the twelve francs.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　Little as was the space occupied by Cosette, it seemed to her as though it were taken from her own, and that that little child diminished the air which her daughters breathed. This woman, like many women of her sort, had a load of caresses and a burden of blows and injuries to dispense each day. If she had not had Cosette, it is certain that her daughters, idolized as they were, would have received the whole of it; but the stranger did them the service to divert the blows to herself. Her daughters received nothing but caresses.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　Cosette could not make a motion which did not draw down upon her head a heavy shower of violent blows and unmerited chastisement.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"6dc7"}},
{"insert":"　　The sweet, feeble being, who should not have understood anything of this world or of God, incessantly punished, scolded, ill-used, beaten, and seeing beside her two little creatures like herself, who lived in a ray of dawn!","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　In the meanwhile, Thenardier, having learned, it is impossible to say by what obscure means, that the child was probably a bastard, and that the mother could not acknowledge it, exacted fifteen francs a month, saying that \"the creature\" was growing and \"eating,\" and threatening to send her away.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　This, it will be remembered, was in 1818.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"732e"}},
{"insert":"　　About two years previously one of those industrial facts which are the grand events of small districts had taken place.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"c3d8"}},
{"insert":"　　This detail is important, and we regard it as useful to develop it at length; we should almost say, to underline it.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"919e"}},
{"insert":"　　From time immemorial, M. sur M. had had for its special industry the imitation of English jet and the black glass trinkets of Germany. This industry had always vegetated, on account of the high price of the raw material, which reacted on the manufacture. At the moment when Fantine returned to M. sur M., an unheard-of transformation had taken place in the production of \"black goods.\" Towards the close of 1815 a man, a stranger, had established himself in the town, and had been inspired with the idea of substituting, in this manufacture, gum-lac for resin, and, for bracelets in particular, slides of sheet-iron simply laid together, for slides of soldered sheet-iron.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5357"}},
{"insert":"　　This very small change had effected a revolution.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ae81"}},
{"insert":"　　This very small change had, in fact, prodigiously reduced the cost of the raw material, which had rendered it possible in the first place, to raise the price of manufacture, a benefit to the country; in the second place, to improve the workmanship, an advantage to the consumer; in the third place, to sell at a lower price, while trebling the profit, which was a benefit to the manufacturer.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　M. Madeleine was in the habit of almost never entering the women's workroom.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"68f8"}},
{"insert":"　　At the head of this room he had placed an elderly spinster, whom the priest had provided for him, and he had full confidence in this superintendent,--a truly respectable person, firm, equitable, upright, full of the charity which consists in giving, but not having in the same degree that charity which consists in understanding and in forgiving.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　It was with this full power, and the conviction that she was doing right, that the superintendent had instituted the suit, judged, condemned, and executed Fantine.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3187"}},
{"insert":"　　As regards the fifty francs, she had given them from a fund which M. Madeleine had intrusted to her for charitable purposes, and for giving assistance to the workwomen, and of which she rendered no account.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"0848"}},
{"insert":"　　Fantine tried to obtain a situation as a servant in the neighborhood; ","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a6c8"}},
{"insert":"she went from house to house.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"d288"}},
{"insert":"　　No one would have her.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5a86"}},
{"insert":"　　She could not leave town.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"1574"}},
{"insert":"　　The second-hand dealer, to whom she was in debt for her furniture--and what furniture!--said to her, \"If you leave, I will have you arrested as a thief.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"991a"}},
{"insert":"　　The householder, whom she owed for her rent, said to her, \"You are young and pretty; you can pay.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ce49"}},
{"insert":"　　She divided the fifty francs between the landlord and the furniture-dealer, returned to the latter three-quarters of his goods, kept only necessaries, and found herself without work, without a trade, with nothing but her bed, and still about fifty francs in debt.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"e4fb"}},
{"insert":"　　She began to make coarse shirts for soldiers of the garrison, and earned twelve sous a day.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"210f"}},
{"insert":"　　Her daughter cost her ten.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"df58"}},
{"insert":"　　It was at this point that she began to pay the Thenardiers irregularly.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"7c1c"}},
{"insert":"　　However, the old woman who lighted her candle for her when she returned at night, taught her the art of living in misery. Back of living on little, there is the living on nothing. These are the two chambers; the first is dark, the second is black.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"8b77"}},
{"insert":"　　Fantine learned how to live without fire entirely in the winter; how to give up a bird which eats a half a farthing's worth of millet every two days; how to make a coverlet of one's petticoat, and a petticoat of one's coverlet; how to save one's candle, by taking one's meals by the light of the opposite window. No one knows all that certain feeble creatures, who have grown old in privation and honesty, can get out of a sou.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"92a9"}},
{"insert":"　　It ends by being a talent.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5057"}},
{"insert":"　　Fantine acquired this sublime talent, and regained a little courage.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"8eac"}},
{"insert":"　　At this epoch she said to a neighbor, \"Bah!","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"41d4"}},
{"insert":"　　I say to myself, by only sleeping five hours, and working all the rest of the time at my sewing, I shall always manage to nearly earn my bread.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　It would have been a great happiness to have her little girl with her in this distress.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"0073"}},
{"insert":"　　She thought of having her come.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"96d9"}},
{"insert":"　　But what then! Make her share her own destitution!","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a8bc"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"d1c4"}},
{"insert":"　　How could she pay them?","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"2b78"}},
{"insert":"　　And the journey! How pay for that?","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"d2bb"}},
{"insert":"　　The old woman who had given her lessons in what may be called the life of indigence, was a sainted spinster named Marguerite, who was pious with a true piety, poor and charitable towards the poor, and even towards the rich, knowing how to write just sufficiently to sign herself Marguerite, and believing in God, which is science.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"359c"}},

{"insert":"　　This life has a morrow.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"affc"}},
{"insert":"　　At first, Fantine had been so ashamed that she had not dared to go out.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"1cfc"}},
{"insert":"　　When she was in the street, she divined that people turned round behind her, and pointed at her; every one stared at her and no one greeted her; the cold and bitter scorn of the passers-by penetrated her very flesh and soul like a north wind.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"20bb"}},
{"insert":"　　It seems as though an unfortunate woman were utterly bare beneath the sarcasm and the curiosity of all in small towns.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"b183"}},
{"insert":"　　In Paris, at least, no one knows you, and this obscurity is a garment. Oh! how she would have liked to betake herself to Paris!","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"bf53"}},
{"insert":"　　Impossible!","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"39dc"}},
{"insert":"　　She was obliged to accustom herself to disrepute, as she had accustomed herself to indigence.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"2cdc"}},
{"insert":"　　Gradually she decided on her course. At the expiration of two or three months she shook off her shame, and began to go about as though there were nothing the matter. \"It is all the same to me,\" she said.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"e32b"}},
{"insert":"　　She went and came, bearing her head well up, with a bitter smile, and was conscious that she was becoming brazen-faced.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"637d"}},
{"insert":"　　Madame Victurnien sometimes saw her passing, from her window, noticed the distress of \"that creature\" who, \"thanks to her,\" had been \"put back in her proper place,\" and congratulated herself. The happiness of the evil-minded is black.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"f88c"}},
{"insert":"　　Excess of toil wore out Fantine, and the little dry cough which troubled her increased.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　She sometimes said to her neighbor, Marguerite, \"Just feel how hot my hands are!\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"02bb"}},
{"insert":"　　The Thenardiers, who were not promptly paid, wrote to her constantly letters whose contents drove her to despair, and whose carriage ruined her. One day they wrote to her that her little Cosette was entirely naked in that cold weather, that she needed a woollen skirt, and that her mother must send at least ten francs for this. She received the letter, and crushed it in her hands all day long. That evening she went into a barber's shop at the corner of the street, and pulled out her comb.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　\"Cut it off.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a42e"}},
{"insert":"　　She purchased a knitted petticoat and sent it to the Thenardiers. This petticoat made the Thenardiers furious.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"109c"}},
{"insert":"　　It was the money that they wanted.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　The poor Lark continued to shiver.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"80ba"}},

{"insert":"　　She put on little round caps which concealed her shorn head, and in which she was still pretty.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　Dark thoughts held possession of Fantine's heart.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　When she saw that she could no longer dress her hair, she began to hate every one about her.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"1707"}},
{"insert":"　　She had long shared the universal veneration for Father Madeleine; yet, by dint of repeating to herself that it was he who had discharged her, that he was the cause of her unhappiness, she came to hate him also, and most of all. When she passed the factory in working hours, when the workpeople were at the door, she affected to laugh and sing.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"b107"}},
{"insert":"　　An old workwoman who once saw her laughing and singing in this fashion said, \"There's a girl who will come to a bad end.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　She took a lover, the first who offered, a man whom she did not love, out of bravado and with rage in her heart.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"1fe9"}},
{"insert":"　　He was a miserable scamp, a sort of mendicant musician, a lazy beggar, who beat her, and who abandoned her as she had taken him, in disgust.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"1cf6"}},
{"insert":"　　She adored her child.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"8756"}},
{"insert":"　　The lower she descended, the darker everything grew about her, the more radiant shone that little angel at the bottom of her heart. She said, \"When I get rich, I will have my Cosette with me;\" and she laughed.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　\"Cosette is ill with a malady which is going the rounds of the neighborhood.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　A miliary fever, they call it. Expensive drugs are required.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4e39"}},
{"insert":"　　This is ruining us, and we can no longer pay for them.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　If you do not send us forty francs before the week is out, the little one will be dead.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"94e4"}},
{"insert":"　　She burst out laughing, and said to her old neighbor:","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"cfc3"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Ah! they are good!","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　These peasants are stupid, truly.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"bd18"}},
{"insert":"　　Nevertheless she went to a dormer window in the staircase and read the letter once more.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a644"}},
{"insert":"　　Then she descended the stairs and emerged, running and leaping and still laughing.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"7908"}},
{"insert":"　　Some one met her and said to her, \"What makes you so gay?\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"f0c6"}},
{"insert":"　　She replied:","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"94d0"}},
{"insert":"　　\"A fine piece of stupidity that some country people have written to me.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　So much for you, you peasants!\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"1b94"}},
{"insert":"　　As she crossed the square, she saw a great many people collected around a carriage of eccentric shape, upon the top of which stood a man dressed in red, who was holding forth.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"d841"}},
{"insert":"　　He was a quack dentist on his rounds, who was offering to the public full sets of teeth, opiates, powders and elixirs.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"85f7"}},
{"insert":"　　Fantine mingled in the group, and began to laugh with the rest at the harangue, which contained slang for the populace and jargon for respectable people.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"f332"}},
{"insert":"　　The tooth-puller espied the lovely, laughing girl, and suddenly exclaimed:","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　\"The palettes,\" replied the dental professor, \"are the front teeth, the two upper ones.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　\"How horrible!\" exclaimed Fantine.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"1c80"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Two napoleons!\" grumbled a toothless old woman who was present. \"Here's a lucky girl!\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"8532"}},
{"insert":"　　Fantine fled and stopped her ears that she might not hear the hoarse voice of the man shouting to her:","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　\"Reflect, my beauty! two napoleons; they may prove of service.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　Fantine returned home.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a6d1"}},

{"insert":"　　\"Can you understand such a thing? Is he not an abominable man?","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　He experienced at that moment, blow upon blow and almost simultaneously, the most violent emotions which he had ever undergone in all his life. To see a woman of the town spit in the mayor's face was a thing so monstrous that, in his most daring flights of fancy, he would have regarded it as a sacrilege to believe it possible. On the other hand, at the very bottom of his thought, he made a hideous comparison as to what this woman was, and as to what this mayor might be; and then he, with horror, caught a glimpse of I know not what simple explanation of this prodigious attack. But when he beheld that mayor, that magistrate, calmly wipe his face and say, \"Set this woman at liberty,\" he underwent a sort of intoxication of amazement; thought and word failed him equally; the sum total of possible astonishment had been exceeded in his case. He remained mute.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　If that is not a horror, what is?","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5a92"}},
{"insert":"　　To dismiss a poor girl who is doing her work honestly! Then I could no longer earn enough, and all this misery followed.

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"7644"}},
{"insert":"　　I will explain it to you, you see:","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"26e2"}},
{"insert":"　　you are earning twelve sous at shirt-making, the price falls to nine sous; and it is not enough to live on. Then one has to become whatever one can.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　As for me, I had my little Cosette, and I was actually forced to become a bad woman. Now you understand how it is that that blackguard of a mayor caused all the mischief.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"1d76"}},
{"insert":"　　After that I stamped on that gentleman's hat in front of the officers' cafe; but he had spoiled my whole dress with snow.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4e3e"}},
{"insert":"　　We women have but one silk dress for evening wear. You see that I did not do wrong deliberately--truly, Monsieur Javert; and everywhere I behold women who are far more wicked than I, and who are much happier.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5ed6"}},
{"insert":"　　M. Madeleine listened to her with profound attention.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a019"}},
{"insert":"　　While she was speaking, he fumbled in his waistcoat, drew out his purse and opened it.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4acc"}},
{"insert":"　　It was empty.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"69c4"}},
{"insert":"　　He put it back in his pocket. He said to Fantine, \"How much did you say that you owed?\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　Fantine, who was looking at Javert only, turned towards him:--","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"15d4"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Was I speaking to you?\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ddf3"}},
{"insert":"　　Then, addressing the soldiers:--","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"1fcb"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Say, you fellows, did you see how I spit in his face? Ah! you old wretch of a mayor, you came here to frighten me, but I'm not afraid of you.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　I am afraid of Monsieur Javert. I am afraid of my good Monsieur Javert!\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"f2ba"}},
{"insert":"　　So saying, she turned to the inspector again:--","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"51c0"}},
{"insert":"　　\"And yet, you see, Mr. Inspector, it is necessary to be just. I understand that you are just, Mr. Inspector; in fact, it is perfectly simple:","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　a man amuses himself by putting snow down a woman's back, and that makes the officers laugh; one must divert themselves in some way; and we--well, we are here for them to amuse themselves with, of course!","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"b309"}},
{"insert":"　　And then, you, you come; you are certainly obliged to preserve order, you lead off the woman who is in the wrong; but on reflection, since you are a good man, you say that I am to be set at liberty; it is for the sake of the little one, for six months in prison would prevent my supporting my child. `Only, don't do it again, you hussy!'","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"1706"}},
{"insert":"　　Oh!","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"95a8"}},
{"insert":"　　But to-day, you see, I cried because it hurt me.

{"insert":"　　Here, feel, give me your hand; don't be afraid-- it is here.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"2883"}},
{"insert":"　　She no longer wept, her voice was caressing; she placed Javert's coarse hand on her delicate, white throat and looked smilingly at him.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"69f8"}},
{"insert":"　　All at once she rapidly adjusted her disordered garments, dropped the folds of her skirt, which had been pushed up as she dragged herself along, almost to the height of her knee, and stepped towards the door, saying to the soldiers in a low voice, and with a friendly nod:--","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"30e4"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Children, Monsieur l'Inspecteur has said that I am to be released, and I am going.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　One step more and she would be in the street.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"1155"}},
{"insert":"　　Javert up to that moment had remained erect, motionless, with his eyes fixed on the ground, cast athwart this scene like some displaced statue, which is waiting to be put away somewhere.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"e0a1"}},
{"insert":"　　The sound of the latch roused him.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"c7a6"}},
{"insert":"　　He raised his head with an expression of sovereign authority, an expression all the more alarming in proportion as the authority rests on a low level, ferocious in the wild beast, atrocious in the man of no estate.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"188b"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Sergeant!\" he cried, \"don't you see that that jade is walking off! Who bade you let her go?\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　\"I,\" said Madeleine.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"68cd"}},
{"insert":"　　Fantine trembled at the sound of Javert's voice, and let go of the latch as a thief relinquishes the article which he has stolen. At the sound of Madeleine's voice she turned around, and from that moment forth she uttered no word, nor dared so much as to breathe freely, but her glance strayed from Madeleine to Javert, and from Javert to Madeleine in turn, according to which was speaking.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3ec1"}},
{"insert":"　　It was evident that Javert must have been exasperated beyond measure before he would permit himself to apostrophize the sergeant as he had done, after the mayor's suggestion that Fantine should be set at liberty.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"e1ad"}},
{"insert":"　　Had he reached the point of forgetting the mayor's presence?","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　Had he finally declared to himself that it was impossible that any \"authority\" should have given such an order, and that the mayor must certainly have said one thing by mistake for another, without intending it?","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"1841"}},
{"insert":"　　Or, in view of the enormities of which he had been a witness for the past two hours, did he say to himself, that it was necessary to recur to supreme resolutions, that it was indispensable that the small should be made great, that the police spy should transform himself into a magistrate, that the policeman should become a dispenser of justice, and that, in this prodigious extremity, order, law, morality, government, society in its entirety, was personified in him, Javert?","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"b39a"}},
{"insert":"　　However that may be, when M. Madeleine uttered that word, _I_, as we have just heard, Police Inspector Javert was seen to turn toward the mayor, pale, cold, with blue lips, and a look of despair, his whole body agitated by an imperceptible quiver and an unprecedented occurrence, and say to him, with downcast eyes but a firm voice:--","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　Here is the true state of the case: I was passing through the square just as you were leading this woman away; there were still groups of people standing about, and I made inquiries and learned everything; it was the townsman who was in the wrong and who should have been arrested by properly conducted police.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a2c6"}},

{"insert":"　　\"Inspector Javert,\" replied M. Madeleine, \"the highest law is conscience.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　My duty demands that this woman shall serve six months in prison.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　\"Heed this well; she will not serve a single day.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"2b6e"}},
{"insert":"　　At this decisive word, Javert ventured to fix a searching look on the mayor and to say, but in a tone of voice that was still profoundly respectful:--","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　She had just seen herself a subject of dispute between two opposing powers.

{"insert":"　　In this conflict, viewed through the exaggerations of terror, these two men had appeared to her like two giants; the one spoke like her demon, the other like her good angel. The angel had conquered the demon, and, strange to say, that which made her shudder from head to foot was the fact that this angel, this liberator, was the very man whom she abhorred, that mayor whom she had so long regarded as the author of all her woes, that Madeleine!

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"cbf2"}},

{"insert":"　　\"I have been a sinner; but when I have my child beside me, it will be a sign that God has pardoned me. While I was leading a bad life, I should not have liked to have my Cosette with me; I could not have borne her sad, astonished eyes.

{"insert":"　　She was a nun as other women are cooks. This type is not so very rare.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"95ed"}},
{"insert":"　　The transition from a drover to a Carmelite is not in the least violent; the one turns into the other without much effort; the fund of ignorance common to the village and the cloister is a preparation ready at hand, and places the boor at once on the same footing as the monk:","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　a little more amplitude in the smock, and it becomes a frock.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"dc39"}},
{"insert":"　　Sister Perpetue was a robust nun from Marines near Pontoise, who chattered her patois, droned, grumbled, sugared the potion according to the bigotry or the hypocrisy of the invalid, treated her patients abruptly, roughly, was crabbed with the dying, almost flung God in their faces, stoned their death agony with prayers mumbled in a rage; was bold, honest, and ruddy.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　Sister Simplice was white, with a waxen pallor.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　Beside Sister Perpetue, she was the taper beside the candle.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"6d56"}},
{"insert":"　　Vincent de Paul has divinely traced the features of the Sister of Charity in these admirable words, in which he mingles as much freedom as servitude:","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"e3b6"}},
{"insert":"　　\"They shall have for their convent only the house of the sick; for cell only a hired room; for chapel only their parish church; for cloister only the streets of the town and the wards of the hospitals; for enclosure only obedience; for gratings only the fear of God; for veil only modesty.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"14ad"}},
{"insert":"　　This ideal was realized in the living person of Sister Simplice:","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"50e2"}},
{"insert":"　　she had never been young, and it seemed as though she would never grow old. No one could have told Sister Simplice's age.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"bf0d"}},
{"insert":"　　She was a person-- we dare not say a woman--who was gentle, austere, well-bred, cold, and who had never lied.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"88af"}},
{"insert":"　　There was, so to speak, silence in her speech; she said just what was necessary, and she possessed a tone of voice which would have equally edified a confessional or enchanted a drawing-room. This delicacy accommodated itself to the serge gown, finding in this harsh contact a continual reminder of heaven and of God.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ad06"}},
{"insert":"　　Let us emphasize one detail. Never to have lied, never to have said, for any interest whatever, even in indifference, any single thing which was not the truth, the sacred truth, was Sister Simplice's distinctive trait; it was the accent of her virtue.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"d9c6"}},
{"insert":"　　On entering the order of Saint Vincent de Paul, she had taken the name of Simplice by special choice.

{"insert":"　　This patron saint suited this soul.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　He listened more attentively, and recognized M. Madeleine's step.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　The cashier sat up in bed, quite awake now, and staring; and through his window-panes he saw the reddish gleam of a lighted window reflected on the opposite wall; from the direction of the rays, it could only come from the window of M.

{"insert":"　　To make the poem of the human conscience, were it only with reference to a single man, were it only in connection with the basest of men, would be to blend all epics into one superior and definitive epic. Conscience is the chaos of chimeras, of lusts, and of temptations; the furnace of dreams; the lair of ideas of which we are ashamed; it is the pandemonium of sophisms; it is the battlefield of the passions. Penetrate, at certain hours, past the livid face of a human being who is engaged in reflection, and look behind, gaze into that soul, gaze into that obscurity.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4394"}},
{"insert":"　　He succeeded in disappearing, sold the Bishop's silver, reserving only the candlesticks as a souvenir, crept from town to town, traversed France, came to M. sur M., conceived the idea which we have mentioned, accomplished what we have related, succeeded in rendering himself safe from seizure and inaccessible, and, thenceforth, established at M. sur M., happy in feeling his conscience saddened by the past and the first half of his existence belied by the last, he lived in peace, reassured and hopeful, having henceforth only two thoughts,--to conceal his name and to sanctify his life; to escape men and to return to God.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　Thus, in spite of all his reserve and all his prudence, he had preserved the Bishop's candlesticks, worn mourning for him, summoned and interrogated all the little Savoyards who passed that way, collected information regarding the families at Faverolles, and saved old Fauchelevent's life, despite the disquieting insinuations of Javert.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　He felt shadows filled with thunders and lightnings descending upon his head.

{"insert":"　　It was thus that he had, when occasion offered, supported with his credit and his funds the linen factory at Boulogne, the flax-spinning industry at Frevent, and the hydraulic manufacture of cloth at Boubers-sur-Canche.

{"insert":"　　When the usher, discreetly opening the door which connected the council-chamber with the court-room, bent over the back of the President's arm-chair and handed him the paper on which was inscribed the line which we have just perused, adding:","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"d011"}},

{"insert":"　　In the midst of his revery he heard some one saying to him, \"Will Monsieur do me the honor to follow me?\" It was the same usher who had turned his back upon him but a moment previously, and who was now bowing to the earth before him.

{"insert":"　　He followed the usher.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"6208"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Monsieur, you are now in the council-chamber; you have only to turn the copper handle of yonder door, and you will find yourself in the court-room, behind the President's chair.\" These words were mingled in his thoughts with a vague memory of narrow corridors and dark staircases which he had recently traversed.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3b91"}},
{"insert":"　　The usher had left him alone.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　The supreme moment had arrived. He sought to collect his faculties, but could not.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"055b"}},
{"insert":"　　It is chiefly at the moment when there is the greatest need for attaching them to the painful realities of life, that the threads of thought snap within the brain.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"2a1d"}},
{"insert":"　　He was in the very place where the judges deliberated and condemned.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3fcf"}},
{"insert":"　　With stupid tranquillity he surveyed this peaceful and terrible apartment, where so many lives had been broken, which was soon to ring with his name, and which his fate was at that moment traversing.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"622b"}},
{"insert":"　　He stared at the wall, then he looked at himself, wondering that it should be that chamber and that it should be he.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"31ec"}},
{"insert":"　　He had eaten nothing for four and twenty hours; he was worn out by the jolts of the cart, but he was not conscious of it. It seemed to him that he felt nothing.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"8be6"}},
{"insert":"　　He approached a black frame which was suspended on the wall, and which contained, under glass, an ancient autograph letter of Jean Nicolas Pache, mayor of Paris and minister, and dated, through an error, no doubt, the 9th of June, of the year II., and in which Pache forwarded to the commune the list of ministers and deputies held in arrest by them.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"82b0"}},
{"insert":"　　Any spectator who had chanced to see him at that moment, and who had watched him, would have imagined, doubtless, that this letter struck him as very curious, for he did not take his eyes from it, and he read it two or three times.

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"b0f6"}},
{"insert":"　　As he dreamed, he turned round, and his eyes fell upon the brass knob of the door which separated him from the Court of Assizes. He had almost forgotten that door.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"e756"}},
{"insert":"　　His glance, calm at first, paused there, remained fixed on that brass handle, then grew terrified, and little by little became impregnated with fear.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a472"}},
{"insert":"　　Beads of perspiration burst forth among his hair and trickled down upon his temples.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"316f"}},
{"insert":"　　At a certain moment he made that indescribable gesture of a sort of authority mingled with rebellion, which is intended to convey, and which does so well convey, \"Pardieu! who compels me to this?\" Then he wheeled briskly round, caught sight of the door through which he had entered in front of him, went to it, opened it, and passed out. He was no longer in that chamber; he was outside in a corridor, a long, narrow corridor, broken by steps and gratings, making all sorts of angles, lighted here and there by lanterns similar to the night taper of invalids, the corridor through which he had approached. He breathed, he listened; not a sound in front, not a sound behind him, and he fled as though pursued.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"2d6f"}},
{"insert":"　　When he had turned many angles in this corridor, he still listened. The same silence reigned, and there was the same darkness around him.

The stone was cold; the perspiration lay ice-cold on his brow; he straightened himself up with a shiver.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"c885"}},
{"insert":"　　Then, there alone in the darkness, trembling with cold and with something else, too, perchance, he meditated.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"628a"}},
{"insert":"　　He had meditated all night long; he had meditated all the day: he heard within him but one voice, which said, \"Alas!\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　A quarter of an hour passed thus.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"66fc"}},
{"insert":"　　At length he bowed his head, sighed with agony, dropped his arms, and retraced his steps. He walked slowly, and as though crushed.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"7df2"}},
{"insert":"　　It seemed as though some one had overtaken him in his flight and was leading him back.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"f6b1"}},
{"insert":"　　He re-entered the council-chamber. The first thing he caught sight of was the knob of the door.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"9059"}},
{"insert":"　　This knob, which was round and of polished brass, shone like a terrible star for him. He gazed at it as a lamb might gaze into the eye of a tiger.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"2d60"}},
{"insert":"　　He could not take his eyes from it.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　Suddenly, without himself knowing how it happened, he found himself near the door; he grasped the knob convulsively; the door opened.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"f91c"}},
{"insert":"　　It was a vast and badly lighted apartment, now full of uproar, now full of silence, where all the apparatus of a criminal case, with its petty and mournful gravity in the midst of the throng, was in process of development.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4949"}},
{"insert":"　　At the one end of the hall, the one where he was, were judges, with abstracted air, in threadbare robes, who were gnawing their nails or closing their eyelids; at the other end, a ragged crowd; lawyers in all sorts of attitudes; soldiers with hard but honest faces; ancient, spotted woodwork, a dirty ceiling, tables covered with serge that was yellow rather than green; doors blackened by handmarks; tap-room lamps which emitted more smoke than light, suspended from nails in the wainscot; on the tables candles in brass candlesticks; darkness, ugliness, sadness; and from all this there was disengaged an austere and august impression, for one there felt that grand human thing which is called the law, and that grand divine thing which is called justice.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"f1a3"}},
{"insert":"　　No one in all that throng paid any attention to him; all glances were directed towards a single point, a wooden bench placed against a small door, in the stretch of wall on the President's left; on this bench, illuminated by several candles, sat a man between two gendarmes.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　This man was the man.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3e0e"}},
{"insert":"　　He thought he was looking at himself, grown old; not absolutely the same in face, of course, but exactly similar in attitude and aspect, with his bristling hair, with that wild and uneasy eye, with that blouse, just as it was on the day when he entered D----, full of hatred, concealing his soul in that hideous mass of frightful thoughts which he had spent nineteen years in collecting on the floor of the prison.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

The prisoner, it was true, and his counsel, \"in good faith,\" was obliged to admit it, had adopted \"a bad system of defence.\" He obstinately denied everything, the theft and his character of convict. An admission upon this last point would certainly have been better, and would have won for him the indulgence of his judges; the counsel had advised him to do this; but the accused had obstinately refused, thinking, no doubt, that he would save everything by admitting nothing.

Two or three times the spectators who were nearest to him heard him say in a low voice, \"That is what comes of not having asked M.

{"insert":"　　In the meantime, the face of the President was stamped with sympathy and sadness; he had exchanged a rapid sign with the district-attorney and a few low-toned words with the assistant judges; he addressed the public, and asked in accents which all understood:--","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a667"}},
{"insert":"　　The child retreated as it had come; the voice died away. Fantine listened for a while longer, then her face clouded over, and M. Madeleine heard her say, in a low voice:","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　She no longer spoke, she no longer breathed; she had raised herself to a sitting posture, her thin shoulder emerged from her chemise; her face, which had been radiant but a moment before, was ghastly, and she seemed to have fixed her eyes, rendered large with terror, on something alarming at the other extremity of the room.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　The half-hour after midnight had just struck when M. Madeleine quitted the Hall of Assizes in Arras.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"9cf6"}},
{"insert":"　　He regained his inn just in time to set out again by the mail-wagon, in which he had engaged his place. A little before six o'clock in the morning he had arrived at M. sur M., and his first care had been to post a letter to M. Laffitte, then to enter the infirmary and see Fantine.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"1113"}},
{"insert":"　　However, he had hardly quitted the audience hall of the Court of Assizes, when the district-attorney, recovering from his first shock, had taken the word to deplore the mad deed of the honorable mayor of M. sur M., to declare that his convictions had not been in the least modified by that curious incident, which would be explained thereafter, and to demand, in the meantime, the condemnation of that Champmathieu, who was evidently the real Jean Valjean. The district-attorney's persistence was visibly at variance with the sentiments of every one, of the public, of the court, and of the jury.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"fde5"}},
{"insert":"　　The counsel for the defence had some difficulty in refuting this harangue and in establishing that, in consequence of the revelations of M. Madeleine, that is to say, of the real Jean Valjean, the aspect of the matter had been thoroughly altered, and that the jury had before their eyes now only an innocent man. Thence the lawyer had drawn some epiphonemas, not very fresh, unfortunately, upon judicial errors, etc., etc.; the President, in his summing up, had joined the counsel for the defence, and in a few minutes the jury had thrown Champmathieu out of the case.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"917c"}},
{"insert":"　　Nevertheless, the district-attorney was bent on having a Jean Valjean; and as he had no longer Champmathieu, he took Madeleine.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"fe7a"}},
{"insert":"　　Immediately after Champmathieu had been set at liberty, the district-attorney shut himself up with the President. They conferred \"as to the necessity of seizing the person of M. le Maire of M. sur M.\" This phrase, in which there was a great deal of of, is the district-attorney's, written with his own hand, on the minutes of his report to the attorney-general. His first emotion having passed off, the President did not offer many objections. Justice must, after all, take its course.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"b1a0"}},
{"insert":"　　And then, when all was said, although the President was a kindly and a tolerably intelligent man, he was, at the same time, a devoted and almost an ardent royalist, and he had been shocked to hear the Mayor of M. sur M. say the Emperor, and not Bonaparte, when alluding to the landing at Cannes.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"6c70"}},
{"insert":"　　The order for his arrest was accordingly despatched. The district-attorney forwarded it to M. sur M. by a special messenger, at full speed, and entrusted its execution to Police Inspector Javert.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"cf12"}},
{"insert":"　　The reader knows that Javert had returned to M. sur M. immediately after having given his deposition.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　Javert was just getting out of bed when the messenger handed him the order of arrest and the command to produce the prisoner.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"fd01"}},
{"insert":"　　The messenger himself was a very clever member of the police, who, in two words, informed Javert of what had taken place at Arras. The order of arrest, signed by the district-attorney, was couched in these words:","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"b028"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Inspector Javert will apprehend the body of the Sieur Madeleine, mayor of M. sur M., who, in this day's session of the court, was recognized as the liberated convict, Jean Valjean.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"e926"}},
{"insert":"　　Any one who did not know Javert, and who had chanced to see him at the moment when he penetrated the antechamber of the infirmary, could have divined nothing of what had taken place, and would have thought his air the most ordinary in the world.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"aba2"}},
{"insert":"　　He was cool, calm, grave, his gray hair was perfectly smooth upon his temples, and he had just mounted the stairs with his habitual deliberation.

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ab83"}},
{"insert":"　　The buckle of his leather stock was under his left ear instead of at the nape of his neck.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　This betrayed unwonted agitation.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3932"}},
{"insert":"　　Javert was a complete character, who never had a wrinkle in his duty or in his uniform; methodical with malefactors, rigid with the buttons of his coat.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"d2bf"}},
{"insert":"　　That he should have set the buckle of his stock awry, it was indispensable that there should have taken place in him one of those emotions which may be designated as internal earthquakes.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"c80a"}},
{"insert":"　　He had come in a simple way, had made a requisition on the neighboring post for a corporal and four soldiers, had left the soldiers in the courtyard, had had Fantine's room pointed out to him by the portress, who was utterly unsuspicious, accustomed as she was to seeing armed men inquiring for the mayor.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"f032"}},
{"insert":"　　On arriving at Fantine's chamber, Javert turned the handle, pushed the door open with the gentleness of a sick-nurse or a police spy, and entered.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ec88"}},
{"insert":"　　Properly speaking, he did not enter.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　In the bend of his elbow the leaden head of his enormous cane, which was hidden behind him, could be seen.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"afa6"}},
{"insert":"　　Thus he remained for nearly a minute, without his presence being perceived.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"c6bd"}},
{"insert":"　　All at once Fantine raised her eyes, saw him, and made M. Madeleine turn round.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"43c7"}},
{"insert":"　　The instant that Madeleine's glance encountered Javert's glance, Javert, without stirring, without moving from his post, without approaching him, became terrible.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"95f4"}},
{"insert":"　　No human sentiment can be as terrible as joy.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"465f"}},
{"insert":"　　It was the visage of a demon who has just found his damned soul.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"01e5"}},
{"insert":"　　The satisfaction of at last getting hold of Jean Valjean caused all that was in his soul to appear in his countenance.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　The depths having been stirred up, mounted to the surface.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"bc65"}},
{"insert":"　　The humiliation of having, in some slight degree, lost the scent, and of having indulged, for a few moments, in an error with regard to Champmathieu, was effaced by pride at having so well and accurately divined in the first place, and of having for so long cherished a just instinct. Javert's content shone forth in his sovereign attitude.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"1767"}},
{"insert":"　　The deformity of triumph overspread that narrow brow.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　All the demonstrations of horror which a satisfied face can afford were there.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"78a7"}},
{"insert":"　　Javert was in heaven at that moment.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5321"}},
{"insert":"　　Without putting the thing clearly to himself, but with a confused intuition of the necessity of his presence and of his success, he, Javert, personified justice, light, and truth in their celestial function of crushing out evil. Behind him and around him, at an infinite distance, he had authority, reason, the case judged, the legal conscience, the public prosecution, all the stars; he was protecting order, he was causing the law to yield up its thunders, he was avenging society, he was lending a helping hand to the absolute, he was standing erect in the midst of a glory.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　There existed in his victory a remnant of defiance and of combat.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"97c2"}},
{"insert":"　　Erect, haughty, brilliant, he flaunted abroad in open day the superhuman bestiality of a ferocious archangel. The terrible shadow of the action which he was accomplishing caused the vague flash of the social sword to be visible in his clenched fist; happy and indignant, he held his heel upon crime, vice, rebellion, perdition, hell; he was radiant, he exterminated, he smiled, and there was an incontestable grandeur in this monstrous Saint Michael.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"2f1a"}},

{"insert":"　　Probity, sincerity, candor, conviction, the sense of duty, are things which may become hideous when wrongly directed; but which, even when hideous, remain grand:","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"dfdc"}},
{"insert":"　　their majesty, the majesty peculiar to the human conscience, clings to them in the midst of horror; they are virtues which have one vice,--error. The honest, pitiless joy of a fanatic in the full flood of his atrocity preserves a certain lugubriously venerable radiance. Without himself suspecting the fact, Javert in his formidable happiness was to be pitied, as is every ignorant man who triumphs. Nothing could be so poignant and so terrible as this face, wherein was displayed all that may be designated as the evil of the good.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4598"}},
{"insert":"　　Her ailing brain comprehended nothing, but the only thing which she did not doubt was that he had come to get her.

{"insert":"　　\"Be at ease; it is not for you that he is come.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　In his eyes, Jean Valjean was a sort of mysterious combatant, who was not to be laid hands upon, a wrestler in the dark whom he had had in his grasp for the last five years, without being able to throw him.

{"insert":"　　Jean Valjean stepped up to this bed, in a twinkling wrenched off the head-piece, which was already in a dilapidated condition, an easy matter to muscles like his, grasped the principal rod like a bludgeon, and glanced at Javert.

{"insert":"　　The old portress who had served him was among the number.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"0c4c"}},
{"insert":"　　On the evening of that day the worthy old woman was sitting in her lodge, still in a thorough fright, and absorbed in sad reflections. The factory had been closed all day, the carriage gate was bolted, the street was deserted.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　There was no one in the house but the two nuns, Sister Perpetue and Sister Simplice, who were watching beside the body of Fantine.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　Towards the hour when M. Madeleine was accustomed to return home, the good portress rose mechanically, took from a drawer the key of M.

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"7f76"}},
{"insert":"　　Then she sat down again on her chair, and became absorbed in thought once more. The poor, good old woman bad done all this without being conscious of it.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　It was M. Madeleine.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a825"}},
{"insert":"　　It was several seconds before she could speak; she had a seizure, as she said herself, when she related the adventure afterwards.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"bb03"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Good God, Monsieur le Maire,\" she cried at last, \"I thought you were--\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　No one ever found out how he had managed to get into the courtyard without opening the big gates.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5557"}},
{"insert":"　　He had, and always carried about him, a pass-key which opened a little side-door; but he must have been searched, and his latch-key must have been taken from him. This point was never explained.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"1170"}},
{"insert":"　　He ascended the staircase leading to his chamber.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"7d6d"}},
{"insert":"　　On arriving at the top, he left his candle on the top step of his stairs, opened his door with very little noise, went and closed his window and his shutters by feeling, then returned for his candle and re-entered his room.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"b2c4"}},
{"insert":"　　It was a useful precaution; it will be recollected that his window could be seen from the street.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a98e"}},
{"insert":"　　He cast a glance about him, at his table, at his chair, at his bed which had not been disturbed for three days.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"59ec"}},
{"insert":"　　No trace of the disorder of the night before last remained.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4cd8"}},
{"insert":"　　The portress had \"done up\" his room; only she had picked out of the ashes and placed neatly on the table the two iron ends of the cudgel and the forty-sou piece which had been blackened by the fire.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4608"}},
{"insert":"　　He took a sheet of paper, on which he wrote:","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"37db"}},
{"insert":"　　\"These are the two tips of my iron-shod cudgel and the forty-sou piece stolen from Little Gervais, which I mentioned at the Court of Assizes,\" and he arranged this piece of paper, the bits of iron, and the coin in such a way that they were the first things to be seen on entering the room.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5242"}},
{"insert":"　　From a cupboard he pulled out one of his old shirts, which he tore in pieces.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"bab8"}},
{"insert":"　　In the strips of linen thus prepared he wrapped the two silver candlesticks.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"d35b"}},
{"insert":"　　He betrayed neither haste nor agitation; and while he was wrapping up the Bishop's candlesticks, he nibbled at a piece of black bread.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"d2d8"}},
{"insert":"　　It was probably the prison-bread which he had carried with him in his flight.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"138c"}},
{"insert":"　　This was proved by the crumbs which were found on the floor of the room when the authorities made an examination later on.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"03e0"}},
{"insert":"　　There came two taps at the door.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"d939"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Come in,\" said he.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"9437"}},
{"insert":"　　It was Sister Simplice.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"6569"}},
{"insert":"　　She was pale; her eyes were red; the candle which she carried trembled in her hand.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"b1cc"}},
{"insert":"　　The peculiar feature of the violences of destiny is, that however polished or cool we may be, they wring human nature from our very bowels, and force it to reappear on the surface.

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3924"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"f9a3"}},
{"insert":"　　\"My good sir, I swear to you by the good God, that not a soul has entered this house all day, nor all the evening, and that I have not even left the door.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

A young girl was weeding in a field, where a huge yellow poster,probably of some outside spectacle, such as a parish festival,was fluttering in the wind.

Napoleon was accustomed to gaze steadily at war; he never added up the heart-rending details, cipher by cipher; ciphers mattered little to him, provided that they furnished the total, victory; he was not alarmed if the beginnings did go astray, since he thought himself the master and the possessor at the end; he knew how to wait, supposing himself to be out of the question, and he treated destiny as his equal:","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"d01c"}},
{"insert":"　　On the 18th of June the moon was full.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"b5b3"}},
{"insert":"　　Its light favored Blucher's ferocious pursuit, betrayed the traces of the fugitives, delivered up that disastrous mass to the eager Prussian cavalry, and aided the massacre.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　Such tragic favors of the night do occur sometimes during catastrophes.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　After the last cannon-shot had been fired, the plain of Mont-Saint-Jean remained deserted.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"f3c5"}},
{"insert":"　　The English occupied the encampment of the French; it is the usual sign of victory to sleep in the bed of the vanquished. They established their bivouac beyond Rossomme.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"0430"}},
{"insert":"　　The Prussians, let loose on the retreating rout, pushed forward.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ed8b"}},
{"insert":"　　Wellington went to the village of Waterloo to draw up his report to Lord Bathurst.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"2598"}},
{"insert":"　　Mont-Saint-Jean was cannonaded, Hougomont was burned, La Haie-Sainte was taken by assault, Papelotte was burned, Plancenoit was burned, La Belle-Alliance beheld the embrace of the two conquerors; these names are hardly known, and Waterloo, which worked not in the battle, bears off all the honor.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　War has frightful beauties which we have not concealed; it has also, we acknowledge, some hideous features.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"2bf7"}},
{"insert":"　　One of the most surprising is the prompt stripping of the bodies of the dead after the victory.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"0f2f"}},
{"insert":"　　The dawn which follows a battle always rises on naked corpses.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"937a"}},
{"insert":"　　Who thus soils the triumph?","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5913"}},
{"insert":"　　What hideous, furtive hand is that which is slipped into the pocket of victory? What pickpockets are they who ply their trade in the rear of glory? Some philosophers--Voltaire among the number--affirm that it is precisely those persons have made the glory.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"9fb4"}},
{"insert":"　　It is the same men, they say; there is no relief corps; those who are erect pillage those who are prone on the earth.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"9c15"}},
{"insert":"　　The hero of the day is the vampire of the night.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"018d"}},
{"insert":"　　One has assuredly the right, after all, to strip a corpse a bit when one is the author of that corpse. For our own part, we do not think so; it seems to us impossible that the same hand should pluck laurels and purloin the shoes from a dead man.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"1a87"}},
{"insert":"　　One thing is certain, which is, that generally after conquerors follow thieves.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　But let us leave the soldier, especially the contemporary soldier, out of the question.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"1652"}},
{"insert":"　　Every army has a rear-guard, and it is that which must be blamed. Bat-like creatures, half brigands and lackeys; all the sorts of vespertillos that that twilight called war engenders; wearers of uniforms, who take no part in the fighting; pretended invalids; formidable limpers; interloping sutlers, trotting along in little carts, sometimes accompanied by their wives, and stealing things which they sell again; beggars offering themselves as guides to officers; soldiers' servants; marauders; armies on the march in days gone by,-- we are not speaking of the present,--dragged all this behind them, so that in the special language they are called \"stragglers.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"31f9"}},
{"insert":"　　No army, no nation, was responsible for those beings; they spoke Italian and followed the Germans, then spoke French and followed the English. It was by one of these wretches, a Spanish straggler who spoke French, that the Marquis of Fervacques, deceived by his Picard jargon, and taking him for one of our own men, was traitorously slain and robbed on the battle-field itself, in the course of the night which followed the victory of Cerisoles.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3a84"}},
{"insert":"　　The rascal sprang from this marauding.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a6af"}},
{"insert":"　　The detestable maxim, Live on the enemy! produced this leprosy, which a strict discipline alone could heal. There are reputations which are deceptive; one does not always know why certain generals, great in other directions, have been so popular. Turenne was adored by his soldiers because he tolerated pillage; evil permitted constitutes part of goodness.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"6d68"}},
{"insert":"　　Turenne was so good that he allowed the Palatinate to be delivered over to fire and blood. The marauders in the train of an army were more or less in number, according as the chief was more or less severe.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5b15"}},
{"insert":"　　Hoche and Marceau had no stragglers; Wellington had few, and we do him the justice to mention it.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　Nevertheless, on the night from the 18th to the 19th of June, the dead were robbed.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"583a"}},
{"insert":"　　Wellington was rigid; he gave orders that any one caught in the act should be shot; but rapine is tenacious. The marauders stole in one corner of the battlefield while others were being shot in another.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3175"}},
{"insert":"　　The moon was sinister over this plain.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3486"}},
{"insert":"　　Towards midnight, a man was prowling about, or rather, climbing in the direction of the hollow road of Ohain.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4b4a"}},
{"insert":"　　To all appearance he was one of those whom we have just described,--neither English nor French, neither peasant nor soldier, less a man than a ghoul attracted by the scent of the dead bodies having theft for his victory, and come to rifle Waterloo.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"19a7"}},
{"insert":"　　He was clad in a blouse that was something like a great coat; he was uneasy and audacious; he walked forwards and gazed behind him.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　Who was this man? The night probably knew more of him than the day.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　He had no sack, but evidently he had large pockets under his coat.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"1721"}},
{"insert":"　　From time to time he halted, scrutinized the plain around him as though to see whether he were observed, bent over abruptly, disturbed something silent and motionless on the ground, then rose and fled. His sliding motion, his attitudes, his mysterious and rapid gestures, caused him to resemble those twilight larvae which haunt ruins, and which ancient Norman legends call the Alleurs.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　Certain nocturnal wading birds produce these silhouettes among the marshes.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"838d"}},
{"insert":"　　A glance capable of piercing all that mist deeply would have perceived at some distance a sort of little sutler's wagon with a fluted wicker hood, harnessed to a famished nag which was cropping the grass across its bit as it halted, hidden, as it were, behind the hovel which adjoins the highway to Nivelles, at the angle of the road from Mont-Saint-Jean to Braine l'Alleud; and in the wagon, a sort of woman seated on coffers and packages. Perhaps there was some connection between that wagon and that prowler.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　A breath, almost a respiration, moved the shrubbery. Quivers which resembled the departure of souls ran through the grass.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　In the distance the coming and going of patrols and the general rounds of the English camp were audible.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"303c"}},
{"insert":"　　Hougomont and La Haie-Sainte continued to burn, forming, one in the west, the other in the east, two great flames which were joined by the cordon of bivouac fires of the English, like a necklace of rubies with two carbuncles at the extremities, as they extended in an immense semicircle over the hills along the horizon.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"b4ed"}},

{"insert":"　　If there is anything terrible, if there exists a reality which surpasses dreams, it is this:","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"2ebd"}},
{"insert":"　　to live, to see the sun; to be in full possession of virile force; to possess health and joy; to laugh valiantly; to rush towards a glory which one sees dazzling in front of one; to feel in one's breast lungs which breathe, a heart which beats, a will which reasons; to speak, think, hope, love; to have a mother, to have a wife, to have children; to have the light--and all at once, in the space of a shout, in less than a minute, to sink into an abyss; to fall, to roll, to crush, to be crushed; to see ears of wheat, flowers, leaves, branches; not to be able to catch hold of anything; to feel one's sword useless, men beneath one, horses on top of one; to struggle in vain, since one's bones have been broken by some kick in the darkness; to feel a heel which makes one's eyes start from their sockets; to bite horses' shoes in one's rage; to stifle, to yell, to writhe; to be beneath, and to say to one's self, \"But just a little while ago I was a living man!\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　There, where that lamentable disaster had uttered its death-rattle, all was silence now.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　Terrible entanglement! There was no longer any slope, for the corpses had levelled the road with the plain, and reached the brim like a well-filled bushel of barley.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"864c"}},
{"insert":"　　A heap of dead bodies in the upper part, a river of blood in the lower part--such was that road on the evening of the 18th of June, 1815.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"7375"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"703f"}},
{"insert":"　　A few paces in front of him, in the hollow road, at the point where the pile of dead came to an end, an open hand, illumined by the moon, projected from beneath that heap of men.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"2c46"}},
{"insert":"　　He did not precisely rise; he remained in a stooping and frightened attitude, with his back turned to the heap of dead, scanning the horizon on his knees, with the whole upper portion of his body supported on his two forefingers, which rested on the earth, and his head peering above the edge of the hollow road. The jackal's four paws suit some actions.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"34f6"}},
{"insert":"　　He bent down again, fumbled among the heap, pushed aside everything that was in his way, seized the hand, grasped the arm, freed the head, pulled out the body, and a few moments later he was dragging the lifeless, or at least the unconscious, man, through the shadows of hollow road.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　There exists in the region of Montfermeil a very ancient superstition, which is all the more curious and all the more precious, because a popular superstition in the vicinity of Paris is like an aloe in Siberia.

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"62f5"}},
{"insert":"　　Goodwives affirm that it is no rarity to encounter at nightfall, in secluded nooks of the forest, a black man with the air of a carter or a wood-chopper, wearing wooden shoes, clad in trousers and a blouse of linen, and recognizable by the fact, that, instead of a cap or hat, he has two immense horns on his head.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　This ought, in fact, to render him recognizable.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　This man is habitually engaged in digging a hole. There are three ways of profiting by such an encounter.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　The first is to approach the man and speak to him.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"efea"}},
{"insert":"　　Then it is seen that the man is simply a peasant, that he appears black because it is nightfall; that he is not digging any hole whatever, but is cutting grass for his cows, and that what had been taken for horns is nothing but a dung-fork which he is carrying on his back, and whose teeth, thanks to the perspective of evening, seemed to spring from his head. The man returns home and dies within the week.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"8683"}},
{"insert":"　　The second way is to watch him, to wait until he has dug his hole, until he has filled it and has gone away; then to run with great speed to the trench, to open it once more and to seize the \"treasure\" which the black man has necessarily placed there.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"44b1"}},
{"insert":"　　In this case one dies within the month.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"be93"}},
{"insert":"　　Finally, the last method is not to speak to the black man, not to look at him, and to flee at the best speed of one's legs. One then dies within the year.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4e32"}},
{"insert":"　　As all three methods are attended with their special inconveniences, the second, which at all events, presents some advantages, among others that of possessing a treasure, if only for a month, is the one most generally adopted.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"0035"}},
{"insert":"　　So bold men, who are tempted by every chance, have quite frequently, as we are assured, opened the holes excavated by the black man, and tried to rob the devil. The success of the operation appears to be but moderate.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ea8c"}},
{"insert":"　　At least, if the tradition is to be believed, and in particular the two enigmatical lines in barbarous Latin, which an evil Norman monk, a bit of a sorcerer, named Tryphon has left on this subject.

{"insert":"　　Such trenches are ordinarily extremely deep; a man sweats, digs, toils all night-- for it must be done at night; he wets his shirt, burns out his candle, breaks his mattock, and when he arrives at the bottom of the hole, when he lays his hand on the \"treasure,\" what does he find? What is the devil's treasure?","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"91b6"}},
{"insert":"　　A sou, sometimes a crown-piece, a stone, a skeleton, a bleeding body, sometimes a spectre folded in four like a sheet of paper in a portfolio, sometimes nothing.

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"2bc2"}},
{"insert":"　　Tryphon does not record these two finds, since Tryphon lived in the twelfth century, and since the devil does not appear to have had the wit to invent powder before Roger Bacon's time, and cards before the time of Charles VI.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　Now, a very short time after the epoch when it seemed to the prosecuting attorney that the liberated convict Jean Valjean during his flight of several days had been prowling around Montfermeil, it was remarked in that village that a certain old road-laborer, named Boulatruelle, had \"peculiar ways\" in the forest.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　This Boulatruelle was a man who was viewed with disfavor by the inhabitants of the district as too respectful, too humble, too prompt in removing his cap to every one, and trembling and smiling in the presence of the gendarmes,--probably affiliated to robber bands, they said; suspected of lying in ambush at verge of copses at nightfall.

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"db76"}},
{"insert":"　　He was encountered towards evening in the most deserted clearings, in the wildest thickets; and he had the appearance of being in search of something, and sometimes he was digging holes.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　These encounters seemed to cause Boulatruelle a lively displeasure.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　It was evident that he sought to hide, and that there was some mystery in what he was doing.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"2a90"}},
{"insert":"　　It was said in the village:","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4bd5"}},
{"insert":"　　\"It is clear that the devil has appeared. Boulatruelle has seen him, and is on the search.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"66a0"}},
{"insert":"　　Some persons, however, were still curious, surmising that in all this there was probably no fabulous treasure of the legends, but some fine windfall of a more serious and palpable sort than the devil's bank-bills, and that the road-mender had half discovered the secret.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"143e"}},
{"insert":"　　The most \"puzzled\" were the school-master and Thenardier, the proprietor of the tavern, who was everybody's friend, and had not disdained to ally himself with Boulatruelle.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　One evening the schoolmaster affirmed that in former times the law would have instituted an inquiry as to what Boulatruelle did in the forest, and that the latter would have been forced to speak, and that he would have been put to the torture in case of need, and that Boulatruelle would not have resisted the water test, for example.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　They made an effort, and got the old road-mender to drinking. Boulatruelle drank an enormous amount, but said very little. He combined with admirable art, and in masterly proportions, the thirst of a gormandizer with the discretion of a judge. Nevertheless, by dint of returning to the charge and of comparing and putting together the few obscure words which he did allow to escape him, this is what Thenardier and the schoolmaster imagined that they had made out:--","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"cfe3"}},
{"insert":"　　One morning, when Boulatruelle was on his way to his work, at daybreak, he had been surprised to see, at a nook of the forest in the underbrush, a shovel and a pickaxe, concealed, as one might say.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　THE WATER QUESTION AT MONTFERMEIL","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"dd4b"}},
{"insert":"　　Montfermeil is situated between Livry and Chelles, on the southern edge of that lofty table-land which separates the Ourcq from the Marne. At the present day it is a tolerably large town, ornamented all the year through with plaster villas, and on Sundays with beaming bourgeois. In 1823 there were at Montfermeil neither so many white houses nor so many well-satisfied citizens:","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"1bb6"}},
{"insert":"　　it was only a village in the forest. Some pleasure-houses of the last century were to be met with there, to be sure, which were recognizable by their grand air, their balconies in twisted iron, and their long windows, whose tiny panes cast all sorts of varying shades of green on the white of the closed shutters; but Montfermeil was none the less a village.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"b4a9"}},
{"insert":"　　Retired cloth-merchants and rusticating attorneys had not discovered it as yet; it was a peaceful and charming place, which was not on the road to anywhere: there people lived, and cheaply, that peasant rustic life which is so bounteous and so easy; only, water was rare there, on account of the elevation of the plateau.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"c18b"}},
{"insert":"　　It was necessary to fetch it from a considerable distance; the end of the village towards Gagny drew its water from the magnificent ponds which exist in the woods there.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"9cdd"}},
{"insert":"　　The other end, which surrounds the church and which lies in the direction of Chelles, found drinking-water only at a little spring half-way down the slope, near the road to Chelles, about a quarter of an hour from Montfermeil.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"b493"}},
{"insert":"　　Thus each household found it hard work to keep supplied with water. The large houses, the aristocracy, of which the Thenardier tavern formed a part, paid half a farthing a bucketful to a man who made a business of it, and who earned about eight sous a day in his enterprise of supplying Montfermeil with water; but this good man only worked until seven o'clock in the evening in summer, and five in winter; and night once come and the shutters on the ground floor once closed, he who had no water to drink went to fetch it for himself or did without it.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"c716"}},
{"insert":"　　This constituted the terror of the poor creature whom the reader has probably not forgotten,--little Cosette.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"21a3"}},
{"insert":"　　It will be remembered that Cosette was useful to the Thenardiers in two ways: they made the mother pay them, and they made the child serve them. So when the mother ceased to pay altogether, the reason for which we have read in preceding chapters, the Thenardiers kept Cosette. She took the place of a servant in their house.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"1cb9"}},
{"insert":"　　In this capacity she it was who ran to fetch water when it was required.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"e1c9"}},
{"insert":"　　So the child, who was greatly terrified at the idea of going to the spring at night, took great care that water should never be lacking in the house.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"7141"}},
{"insert":"　　Christmas of the year 1823 was particularly brilliant at Montfermeil. The beginning of the winter had been mild; there had been neither snow nor frost up to that time.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"fc89"}},
{"insert":"　　Some mountebanks from Paris had obtained permission of the mayor to erect their booths in the principal street of the village, and a band of itinerant merchants, under protection of the same tolerance, had constructed their stalls on the Church Square, and even extended them into Boulanger Alley, where, as the reader will perhaps remember, the Thenardiers' hostelry was situated. These people filled the inns and drinking-shops, and communicated to that tranquil little district a noisy and joyous life.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"d27b"}},
{"insert":"　　In order to play the part of a faithful historian, we ought even to add that, among the curiosities displayed in the square, there was a menagerie, in which frightful clowns, clad in rags and coming no one knew whence, exhibited to the peasants of Montfermeil in 1823 one of those horrible Brazilian vultures, such as our Royal Museum did not possess until 1845, and which have a tricolored cockade for an eye. I believe that naturalists call this bird Caracara Polyborus; it belongs to the order of the Apicides, and to the family of the vultures.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ef95"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a2aa"}},
{"insert":"　　This room resembled all drinking-shop rooms,--tables, pewter jugs, bottles, drinkers, smokers; but little light and a great deal of noise. The date of the year 1823 was indicated, nevertheless, by two objects which were then fashionable in the bourgeois class:","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5b59"}},
{"insert":"　　We find in them a quantity of small seed which we cannot sift out, and which we are obliged to send through the mill-stones; there are tares, fennel, vetches, hempseed, fox-tail, and a host of other weeds, not to mention pebbles, which abound in certain wheat, especially in Breton wheat.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"d33b"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4975"}},
{"insert":"　　Thenardier had just passed his fiftieth birthday; Madame Thenardier was approaching her forties, which is equivalent to fifty in a woman; so that there existed a balance of age between husband and wife.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"853c"}},
{"insert":"　　Our readers have possibly preserved some recollection of this Thenardier woman, ever since her first appearance,--tall, blond, red, fat, angular, square, enormous, and agile; she belonged, as we have said, to the race of those colossal wild women, who contort themselves at fairs with paving-stones hanging from their hair. She did everything about the house,--made the beds, did the washing, the cooking, and everything else.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"93d4"}},
{"insert":"　　Cosette was her only servant; a mouse in the service of an elephant.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"b9e8"}},
{"insert":"　　Everything trembled at the sound of her voice,--window panes, furniture, and people. Her big face, dotted with red blotches, presented the appearance of a skimmer.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"7a10"}},
{"insert":"　　She had a beard.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4dc0"}},
{"insert":"　　Except for the romances which she had read, and which made the affected lady peep through the ogress at times, in a very queer way, the idea would never have occurred to any one to say of her, \"That is a woman.\" This Thenardier female was like the product of a wench engrafted on a fishwife.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"1625"}},
{"insert":"　　When one heard her speak, one said, \"That is a gendarme\"; when one saw her drink, one said, \"That is a carter\"; when one saw her handle Cosette, one said, \"That is the hangman.\" One of her teeth projected when her face was in repose.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"b494"}},
{"insert":"　　His cunning began here; he smiled habitually, by way of precaution, and was almost polite to everybody, even to the beggar to whom he refused half a farthing. He had the glance of a pole-cat and the bearing of a man of letters. He greatly resembled the portraits of the Abbe Delille. His coquetry consisted in drinking with the carters.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　No one had ever succeeded in rendering him drunk.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　He smoked a big pipe. He wore a blouse, and under his blouse an old black coat.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　He made pretensions to literature and to materialism.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"6e10"}},
{"insert":"　　There were certain names which he often pronounced to support whatever things he might be saying,--Voltaire, Raynal, Parny, and, singularly enough, Saint Augustine.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5fbc"}},
{"insert":"　　He declared that he had \"a system.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　In addition, he was a great swindler.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　A filousophe [philosophe], a scientific thief. The species does exist.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"bd84"}},
{"insert":"　　It will be remembered that he pretended to have served in the army; he was in the habit of relating with exuberance, how, being a sergeant in the 6th or the 9th light something or other, at Waterloo, he had alone, and in the presence of a squadron of death-dealing hussars, covered with his body and saved from death, in the midst of the grape-shot, \"a general, who had been dangerously wounded.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　He was a liberal, a classic, and a Bonapartist.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ff50"}},
{"insert":"　　We believe that he had simply studied in Holland for an inn-keeper.

As for his prowess at Waterloo, the reader is already acquainted with that.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"29cd"}},
{"insert":"　　It will be perceived that he exaggerated it a trifle. Ebb and flow, wandering, adventure, was the leven of his existence; a tattered conscience entails a fragmentary life, and, apparently at the stormy epoch of June 18, 1815, Thenardier belonged to that variety of marauding sutlers of which we have spoken, beating about the country, selling to some, stealing from others, and travelling like a family man, with wife and children, in a rickety cart, in the rear of troops on the march, with an instinct for always attaching himself to the victorious army.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"337d"}},
{"insert":"　　This quibus, composed of purses and watches, of gold rings and silver crosses, gathered in harvest-time in furrows sown with corpses, did not amount to a large total, and did not carry this sutler turned eating-house-keeper very far.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"f498"}},
{"insert":"　　Thenardier had that peculiar rectilinear something about his gestures which, accompanied by an oath, recalls the barracks, and by a sign of the cross, the seminary.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　He was a fine talker. He allowed it to be thought that he was an educated man.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　He did not disdain his servants, which caused his wife to dispense with them. This giantess was jealous.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　This is the worst species; hypocrisy enters into it.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"8d97"}},
{"insert":"　　It is not that Thenardier was not, on occasion, capable of wrath to quite the same degree as his wife; but this was very rare, and at such times, since he was enraged with the human race in general, as he bore within him a deep furnace of hatred.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"b918"}},
{"insert":"　　And since he was one of those people who are continually avenging their wrongs, who accuse everything that passes before them of everything which has befallen them, and who are always ready to cast upon the first person who comes to hand, as a legitimate grievance, the sum total of the deceptions, the bankruptcies, and the calamities of their lives,--when all this leaven was stirred up in him and boiled forth from his mouth and eyes, he was terrible. Woe to the person who came under his wrath at such a time!","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"1bbb"}},
{"insert":"　　He directed everything by a sort of invisible and constant magnetic action. A word was sufficient for him, sometimes a sign; the mastodon obeyed. Thenardier was a sort of special and sovereign being in Madame Thenardier's eyes, though she did not thoroughly realize it.

{"insert":"　　\"Well, go and get some, then!\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"29a1"}},
{"insert":"　　 The line of open-air booths starting at the church, extended, as the reader will remember, as far as the hostelry of the Thenardiers. These booths were all illuminated, because the citizens would soon pass on their way to the midnight mass, with candles burning in paper funnels, which, as the schoolmaster, then seated at the table at the Thenardiers' observed, produced \"a magical effect.\" In compensation, not a star was visible in the sky.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"9547"}},
{"insert":"　　The last of these stalls, established precisely opposite the Thenardiers' door, was a toy-shop all glittering with tinsel, glass, and magnificent objects of tin.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a88a"}},
{"insert":"　　In the first row, and far forwards, the merchant had placed on a background of white napkins, an immense doll, nearly two feet high, who was dressed in a robe of pink crepe, with gold wheat-ears on her head, which had real hair and enamel eyes.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"1ef6"}},
{"insert":"　　All that day, this marvel had been displayed to the wonderment of all passers-by under ten years of age, without a mother being found in Montfermeil sufficiently rich or sufficiently extravagant to give it to her child. Eponine and Azelma had passed hours in contemplating it, and Cosette herself had ventured to cast a glance at it, on the sly, it is true.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"932e"}},
{"insert":"　　At the moment when Cosette emerged, bucket in hand, melancholy and overcome as she was, she could not refrain from lifting her eyes to that wonderful doll, towards the lady, as she called it. The poor child paused in amazement.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"1b0d"}},
{"insert":"　　She had not yet beheld that doll close to.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　The whole shop seemed a palace to her: the doll was not a doll; it was a vision.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"91b1"}},
{"insert":"　　It was joy, splendor, riches, happiness, which appeared in a sort of chimerical halo to that unhappy little being so profoundly engulfed in gloomy and chilly misery.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ae52"}},
{"insert":"　　With the sad and innocent sagacity of childhood, Cosette measured the abyss which separated her from that doll. She said to herself that one must be a queen, or at least a princess, to have a \"thing\" like that.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ede9"}},
{"insert":"　　She gazed at that beautiful pink dress, that beautiful smooth hair, and she thought, \"How happy that doll must be!\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　She thought she was gazing at paradise.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"8407"}},
{"insert":"　　There were other dolls behind the large one, which seemed to her to be fairies and genii.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3269"}},
{"insert":"　　The merchant, who was pacing back and forth in front of his shop, produced on her somewhat the effect of being the Eternal Father.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"d992"}},
{"insert":"　　In this adoration she forgot everything, even the errand with which she was charged.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"74d8"}},
{"insert":"　　All at once the Thenardier's coarse voice recalled her to reality: \"What, you silly jade! you have not gone?","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"1d1a"}},
{"insert":"　　She did not glance at the display of a single other merchant.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"58bf"}},
{"insert":"　　So long as she was in Boulanger Lane and in the neighborhood of the church, the lighted stalls illuminated the road; but soon the last light from the last stall vanished.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4db3"}},
{"insert":"　　The poor child found herself in the dark. She plunged into it.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"0362"}},
{"insert":"　　Only, as a certain emotion overcame her, she made as much motion as possible with the handle of the bucket as she walked along.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"d863"}},
{"insert":"　　This made a noise which afforded her company.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3cfc"}},
{"insert":"　　The further she went, the denser the darkness became.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3051"}},
{"insert":"　　There was no one in the streets.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"59e7"}},
{"insert":"　　However, she did encounter a woman, who turned around on seeing her, and stood still, muttering between her teeth: \"Where can that child be going?","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"60d9"}},
{"insert":"　　Is it a werewolf child?\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"09b0"}},
{"insert":"　　Then the woman recognized Cosette.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5570"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Well,\" said she, \"it's the Lark!\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"b75a"}},
{"insert":"　　In this manner Cosette traversed the labyrinth of tortuous and deserted streets which terminate in the village of Montfermeil on the side of Chelles.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"1c7e"}},
{"insert":"　　So long as she had the houses or even the walls only on both sides of her path, she proceeded with tolerable boldness.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"c092"}},
{"insert":"　　From time to time she caught the flicker of a candle through the crack of a shutter--this was light and life; there were people there, and it reassured her.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"247a"}},
{"insert":"　　But in proportion as she advanced, her pace slackened mechanically, as it were. When she had passed the corner of the last house, Cosette paused. It had been hard to advance further than the last stall; it became impossible to proceed further than the last house. She set her bucket on the ground, thrust her hand into her hair, and began slowly to scratch her head,--a gesture peculiar to children when terrified and undecided what to do.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ba90"}},
{"insert":"　　It was no longer Montfermeil; it was the open fields.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"36ea"}},
{"insert":"　　Black and desert space was before her. She gazed in despair at that darkness, where there was no longer any one, where there were beasts, where there were spectres, possibly. She took a good look, and heard the beasts walking on the grass, and she distinctly saw spectres moving in the trees.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"097d"}},
{"insert":"　　Then she seized her bucket again; fear had lent her audacity.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"9cd7"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Bah!\" said she; \"I will tell him that there was no more water!\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"8970"}},
{"insert":"　　And she resolutely re-entered Montfermeil.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　Hardly had she gone a hundred paces when she paused and began to scratch her head again.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"f285"}},
{"insert":"　　Now it was the Thenardier who appeared to her, with her hideous, hyena mouth, and wrath flashing in her eyes. The child cast a melancholy glance before her and behind her. What was she to do?","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　What was to become of her?","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4b68"}},
{"insert":"　　It was before the Thenardier that she recoiled.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5c67"}},
{"insert":"　　She resumed her path to the spring, and began to run.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"8c53"}},
{"insert":"　　She emerged from the village, she entered the forest at a run, no longer looking at or listening to anything. She only paused in her course when her breath failed her; but she did not halt in her advance.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"96f4"}},
{"insert":"　　She went straight before her in desperation.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a37e"}},
{"insert":"　　As she ran she felt like crying.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"04f4"}},

{"insert":"　　 On the afternoon of that same Christmas Day, 1823, a man had walked for rather a long time in the most deserted part of the Boulevard de l'Hopital in Paris.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"8114"}},
{"insert":"　　This man had the air of a person who is seeking lodgings, and he seemed to halt, by preference, at the most modest houses on that dilapidated border of the faubourg Saint-Marceau.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"fdff"}},
{"insert":"　　This is a very rare mixture which inspires intelligent hearts with that double respect which one feels for the man who is very poor, and for the man who is very worthy. He wore a very old and very well brushed round hat; a coarse coat, worn perfectly threadbare, of an ochre yellow, a color that was not in the least eccentric at that epoch; a large waistcoat with pockets of a venerable cut; black breeches, worn gray at the knee, stockings of black worsted; and thick shoes with copper buckles. He would have been pronounced a preceptor in some good family, returned from the emigration.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"424a"}},
{"insert":"　　There was in the depth of his glance an indescribable melancholy serenity. In his left hand he carried a little bundle tied up in a handkerchief; in his right he leaned on a sort of a cudgel, cut from some hedge. This stick had been carefully trimmed, and had an air that was not too threatening; the most had been made of its knots, and it had received a coral-like head, made from red wax:","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　Outside of Paris, he held his hat decked with white ostrich plumes on his knees enwrapped in high English gaiters; when he re-entered the city, he put on his hat and saluted rarely; he stared coldly at the people, and they returned it in kind.

{"insert":"　　Once in the forest he slackened his pace, and began a careful examination of all the trees, advancing, step by step, as though seeking and following a mysterious road known to himself alone.

{"insert":"　　At last he arrived, by dint of feeling his way inch by inch, at a clearing where there was a great heap of whitish stones. He stepped up briskly to these stones, and examined them attentively through the mists of night, as though he were passing them in review. A large tree, covered with those excrescences which are the warts of vegetation, stood a few paces distant from the pile of stones.

{"insert":"　　\"Yes, sir.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"7426"}},

{"insert":"　　I have only a little lead sword, no longer than that.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　Wealthy travellers are not so polite.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　The corners of her mouth had that curve of habitual anguish which is seen in condemned persons and desperately sick people.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　Her hands were, as her mother had divined, \"ruined with chilblains.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　The fire which illuminated her at that moment brought into relief all the angles of her bones, and rendered her thinness frightfully apparent.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"bc4b"}},
{"insert":"　　As she was always shivering, she had acquired the habit of pressing her knees one against the other. Her entire clothing was but a rag which would have inspired pity in summer, and which inspired horror in winter.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"8334"}},
{"insert":"　　All she had on was hole-ridden linen, not a scrap of woollen.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"908a"}},
{"insert":"　　Her skin was visible here and there and everywhere black and blue spots could be descried, which marked the places where the Thenardier woman had touched her. Her naked legs were thin and red.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"532e"}},
{"insert":"　　The hollows in her neck were enough to make one weep.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"c151"}},
{"insert":"　　This child's whole person, her mien, her attitude, the sound of her voice, the intervals which she allowed to elapse between one word and the next, her glance, her silence, her slightest gesture, expressed and betrayed one sole idea,--fear.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5b17"}},
{"insert":"　　Fear was diffused all over her; she was covered with it, so to speak; fear drew her elbows close to her hips, withdrew her heels under her petticoat, made her occupy as little space as possible, allowed her only the breath that was absolutely necessary, and had become what might be called the habit of her body, admitting of no possible variation except an increase.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"2a6b"}},
{"insert":"　　In the depths of her eyes there was an astonished nook where terror lurked.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"98ab"}},
{"insert":"　　Her fear was such, that on her arrival, wet as she was, Cosette did not dare to approach the fire and dry herself, but sat silently down to her work again.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ea2c"}},
{"insert":"　　The expression in the glance of that child of eight years was habitually so gloomy, and at times so tragic, that it seemed at certain moments as though she were on the verge of becoming an idiot or a demon.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"2642"}},
{"insert":"　　As we have stated, she had never known what it is to pray; she had never set foot in a church.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　The man in the yellow coat never took his eyes from Cosette.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　She had completely forgotten the bread.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"6912"}},
{"insert":"　　Cosette plunged her hand into the pocket of her apron, and turned green. The fifteen-sou piece was not there.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　The unhappy little creature could not find a word to say.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　She was petrified.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"fcf7"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Have you lost that fifteen-sou piece?\" screamed the Thenardier, hoarsely, \"or do you want to rob me of it?\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3a7a"}},
{"insert":"　　At the same time, she stretched out her arm towards the cat-o'-nine-tails which hung on a nail in the chimney-corner.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"6e44"}},
{"insert":"　　This formidable gesture restored to Cosette sufficient strength to shriek:--","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"c549"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Mercy, Madame, Madame!","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"6db9"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"1efc"}},
{"insert":"　　The Thenardier took down the whip.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"944b"}},
{"insert":"　　In the meantime, the man in the yellow coat had been fumbling in the fob of his waistcoat, without any one having noticed his movements. Besides, the other travellers were drinking or playing cards, and were not paying attention to anything.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4b08"}},
{"insert":"　　Cosette contracted herself into a ball, with anguish, within the angle of the chimney, endeavoring to gather up and conceal her poor half-nude limbs.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"e990"}},
{"insert":"　　The Thenardier raised her arm.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4899"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Pardon me, Madame,\" said the man, \"but just now I caught sight of something which had fallen from this little one's apron pocket, and rolled aside.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　Perhaps this is it.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"e839"}},
{"insert":"　　At the same time he bent down and seemed to be searching on the floor for a moment.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"1486"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Exactly; here it is,\" he went on, straightening himself up.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"023b"}},
{"insert":"　　And he held out a silver coin to the Thenardier.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4af3"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Yes, that's it,\" said she.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"9e91"}},
{"insert":"　　It was not it, for it was a twenty-sou piece; but the Thenardier found it to her advantage.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"7535"}},
{"insert":"　　She put the coin in her pocket, and confined herself to casting a fierce glance at the child, accompanied with the remark, \"Don't let this ever happen again!\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"f92c"}},
{"insert":"　　Cosette returned to what the Thenardier called \"her kennel,\" and her large eyes, which were riveted on the traveller, began to take on an expression such as they had never worn before. Thus far it was only an innocent amazement, but a sort of stupefied confidence was mingled with it.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"7245"}},
{"insert":"　　\"By the way, would you like some supper?\" the Thenardier inquired of the traveller.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"2f77"}},
{"insert":"　　He made no reply.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"6188"}},
{"insert":"　　He appeared to be absorbed in thought.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"b97a"}},
{"insert":"　　\"What sort of a man is that?\" she muttered between her teeth. \"He's some frightfully poor wretch.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"bdfa"}},
{"insert":"　　He hasn't a sou to pay for a supper.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"19af"}},
{"insert":"　　Will he even pay me for his lodging?","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4f34"}},
{"insert":"　　It's very lucky, all the same, that it did not occur to him to steal the money that was on the floor.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"b42b"}},
{"insert":"　　In the meantime, a door had opened, and Eponine and Azelma entered.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5fc3"}},
{"insert":"　　They were two really pretty little girls, more bourgeois than peasant in looks, and very charming; the one with shining chestnut tresses, the other with long black braids hanging down her back, both vivacious, neat, plump, rosy, and healthy, and a delight to the eye.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"6f3b"}},
{"insert":"　　They were warmly clad, but with so much maternal art that the thickness of the stuffs did not detract from the coquetry of arrangement.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"468b"}},
{"insert":"　　There was a hint of winter, though the springtime was not wholly effaced.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"6127"}},
{"insert":"　　Light emanated from these two little beings. Besides this, they were on the throne.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3575"}},
{"insert":"　　In their toilettes, in their gayety, in the noise which they made, there was sovereignty. When they entered, the Thenardier said to them in a grumbling tone which was full of adoration, \"Ah! there you are, you children!\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"e756"}},
{"insert":"　　Then drawing them, one after the other to her knees, smoothing their hair, tying their ribbons afresh, and then releasing them with that gentle manner of shaking off which is peculiar to mothers, she exclaimed, \"What frights they are!\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"48b2"}},
{"insert":"　　They went and seated themselves in the chimney-corner. They had a doll, which they turned over and over on their knees with all sorts of joyous chatter.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"7901"}},
{"insert":"　　From time to time Cosette raised her eyes from her knitting, and watched their play with a melancholy air.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"6b83"}},
{"insert":"　　Eponine and Azelma did not look at Cosette.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"eff6"}},
{"insert":"　　She was the same as a dog to them.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"60a4"}},
{"insert":"　　These three little girls did not yet reckon up four and twenty years between them, but they already represented the whole society of man; envy on the one side, disdain on the other.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a66e"}},
{"insert":"　　The doll of the Thenardier sisters was very much faded, very old, and much broken; but it seemed none the less admirable to Cosette, who had never had a doll in her life, a real doll, to make use of the expression which all children will understand.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3a15"}},
{"insert":"　　All at once, the Thenardier, who had been going back and forth in the room, perceived that Cosette's mind was distracted, and that, instead of working, she was paying attention to the little ones at their play.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"dae2"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Ah!","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"1935"}},
{"insert":"　　I've caught you at it!\" she cried.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4a92"}},
{"insert":"　　\"So that's the way you work! I'll make you work to the tune of the whip; that I will.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"cac4"}},
{"insert":"　　The stranger turned to the Thenardier, without quitting his chair.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"f9b0"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Bah, Madame,\" he said, with an almost timid air, \"let her play!\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"d0c1"}},
{"insert":"　　Such a wish expressed by a traveller who had eaten a slice of mutton and had drunk a couple of bottles of wine with his supper, and who had not the air of being frightfully poor, would have been equivalent to an order.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"28af"}},
{"insert":"　　But that a man with such a hat should permit himself such a desire, and that a man with such a coat should permit himself to have a will, was something which Madame Thenardier did not intend to tolerate.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"561a"}},
{"insert":"　　She retorted with acrimony:--","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"2ca0"}},
{"insert":"　　\"She must work, since she eats.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"17d1"}},
{"insert":"　　I don't feed her to do nothing.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"c29a"}},
{"insert":"　　\"What is she making?\" went on the stranger, in a gentle voice which contrasted strangely with his beggarly garments and his porter's shoulders.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3e38"}},
{"insert":"　　The Thenardier deigned to reply:--","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a979"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Stockings, if you please.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　Stockings for my little girls, who have none, so to speak, and who are absolutely barefoot just now.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a3cb"}},
{"insert":"　　The man looked at Cosette's poor little red feet, and continued:--","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"1713"}},
{"insert":"　　\"When will she have finished this pair of stockings?\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a31d"}},

{"insert":"　　\"And how much will that pair of stockings be worth when she has finished them?\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"0481"}},
{"insert":"　　The Thenardier cast a glance of disdain on him.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"335e"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Thirty sous at least.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"73a7"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Will you sell them for five francs?\" went on the man.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"7678"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Good heavens!\" exclaimed a carter who was listening, with a loud laugh; \"five francs! the deuce, I should think so! five balls!\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"2473"}},
{"insert":"　　Thenardier thought it time to strike in.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"de6a"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Yes, sir; if such is your fancy, you will be allowed to have that pair of stockings for five francs.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　We can refuse nothing to travellers.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"8616"}},
{"insert":"　　\"You must pay on the spot,\" said the Thenardier, in her curt and peremptory fashion.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"1890"}},
{"insert":"　　\"I will buy that pair of stockings,\" replied the man, \"and,\" he added, drawing a five-franc piece from his pocket, and laying it on the table, \"I will pay for them.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"46e9"}},
{"insert":"　　Then he turned to Cosette.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"7ccd"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Now I own your work; play, my child.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"f91e"}},
{"insert":"　　The carter was so much touched by the five-franc piece, that he abandoned his glass and hastened up.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"108c"}},
{"insert":"　　\"But it's true!\" he cried, examining it.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　\"A real hind wheel! and not counterfeit!\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4843"}},
{"insert":"　　Thenardier approached and silently put the coin in his pocket.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"f4c9"}},
{"insert":"　　The Thenardier had no reply to make.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"e9f2"}},
{"insert":"　　She bit her lips, and her face assumed an expression of hatred.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"17d6"}},
{"insert":"　　In the meantime, Cosette was trembling.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"c575"}},
{"insert":"　　She ventured to ask:--","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"6300"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Is it true, Madame?","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"23bd"}},
{"insert":"　　May I play?\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"05a5"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Play!\" said the Thenardier, in a terrible voice.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"2e1b"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Thanks, Madame,\" said Cosette.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"de53"}},
{"insert":"　　And while her mouth thanked the Thenardier, her whole little soul thanked the traveller.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"71f3"}},
{"insert":"　　Thenardier had resumed his drinking; his wife whispered in his ear:--","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"9a75"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Who can this yellow man be?\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"23e8"}},
{"insert":"　　\"I have seen millionaires with coats like that,\" replied Thenardier, in a sovereign manner.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"6f37"}},
{"insert":"　　Cosette had dropped her knitting, but had not left her seat. Cosette always moved as little as possible.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"8dbf"}},
{"insert":"　　She picked up some old rags and her little lead sword from a box behind her.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"9566"}},
{"insert":"　　Eponine and Azelma paid no attention to what was going on. They had just executed a very important operation; they had just got hold of the cat.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"69fc"}},
{"insert":"　　They had thrown their doll on the ground, and Eponine, who was the elder, was swathing the little cat, in spite of its mewing and its contortions, in a quantity of clothes and red and blue scraps.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"d445"}},
{"insert":"　　While performing this serious and difficult work she was saying to her sister in that sweet and adorable language of children, whose grace, like the splendor of the butterfly's wing, vanishes when one essays to fix it fast.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"6ecc"}},
{"insert":"　　\"You see, sister, this doll is more amusing than the other. She twists, she cries, she is warm.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"c595"}},
{"insert":"　　And then you will see her ears, and then you will see her tail and it will amaze you. And you will say to me, `Ah! Mon Dieu!' and I will say to you: `Yes, Madame, it is my little girl.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"858e"}},
{"insert":"　　Little girls are made like that just at present.'\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　Azelma listened admiringly to Eponine.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"08bd"}},
{"insert":"　　In the meantime, the drinkers had begun to sing an obscene song, and to laugh at it until the ceiling shook.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"f382"}},
{"insert":"　　Thenardier accompanied and encouraged them.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"09f0"}},
{"insert":"　　As birds make nests out of everything, so children make a doll out of anything which comes to hand.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"189f"}},
{"insert":"　　While Eponine and Azelma were bundling up the cat, Cosette, on her side, had dressed up her sword. That done, she laid it in her arms, and sang to it softly, to lull it to sleep.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"35cf"}},
{"insert":"　　The doll is one of the most imperious needs and, at the same time, one of the most charming instincts of feminine childhood. To care for, to clothe, to deck, to dress, to undress, to redress, to teach, scold a little, to rock, to dandle, to lull to sleep, to imagine that something is some one,--therein lies the whole woman's future.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"0f0f"}},
{"insert":"　　While dreaming and chattering, making tiny outfits, and baby clothes, while sewing little gowns, and corsages and bodices, the child grows into a young girl, the young girl into a big girl, the big girl into a woman.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　The first child is the continuation of the last doll.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　Cosette raised her eyes; she gazed at the man approaching her with that doll as she might have gazed at the sun; she heard the unprecedented words, \"It is for you\"; she stared at him; she stared at the doll; then she slowly retreated, and hid herself at the extreme end, under the table in a corner of the wall.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　The tavern-keeper stared alternately at the doll and at the traveller; he seemed to be scenting out the man, as he would have scented out a bag of money.

{"insert":"　　\"I shall call her Catherine,\" she said.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"e67a"}},
{"insert":"　　This stranger, this unknown individual, who had the air of a visit which Providence was making on Cosette, was the person whom the Thenardier hated worse than any one in the world at that moment.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4c21"}},
{"insert":"　　However, it was necessary to control herself. Habituated as she was to dissimulation through endeavoring to copy her husband in all his actions, these emotions were more than she could endure.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a372"}},

{"insert":"　　All the other travellers, both pedlers and carters, had withdrawn a little, and had ceased singing. They were staring at him from a distance, with a sort of respectful awe.

{"insert":"　　He took the candle; the man picked up his bundle and cudgel, and Thenardier conducted him to a chamber on the first floor, which was of rare splendor, all furnished in mahogany, with a low bedstead, curtained with red calico.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3e1a"}},
{"insert":"　　\"What is this?\" said the traveller.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"6883"}},
{"insert":"　　\"It is really our bridal chamber,\" said the tavern-keeper. \"My wife and I occupy another.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"eade"}},
{"insert":"　　This is only entered three or four times a year.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"0b76"}},
{"insert":"　　\"I should have liked the stable quite as well,\" said the man, abruptly.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4436"}},
{"insert":"　　Thenardier pretended not to hear this unamiable remark.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"c278"}},
{"insert":"　　He lighted two perfectly fresh wax candles which figured on the chimney-piece. A very good fire was flickering on the hearth.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"fcee"}},
{"insert":"　　On the chimney-piece, under a glass globe, stood a woman's head-dress in silver wire and orange flowers.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"953d"}},
{"insert":"　　\"And what is this?\" resumed the stranger.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"7196"}},
{"insert":"　　\"That, sir,\" said Thenardier, \"is my wife's wedding bonnet.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"9062"}},
{"insert":"　　The traveller surveyed the object with a glance which seemed to say, \"There really was a time, then, when that monster was a maiden?\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"22d1"}},
{"insert":"　　Thenardier lied, however.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"330d"}},
{"insert":"　　When he had leased this paltry building for the purpose of converting it into a tavern, he had found this chamber decorated in just this manner, and had purchased the furniture and obtained the orange flowers at second hand, with the idea that this would cast a graceful shadow on \"his spouse,\" and would result in what the English call respectability for his house.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"eee0"}},
{"insert":"　　When the traveller turned round, the host had disappeared. Thenardier had withdrawn discreetly, without venturing to wish him a good night, as he did not wish to treat with disrespectful cordiality a man whom he proposed to fleece royally the following morning.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"60e3"}},
{"insert":"　　The inn-keeper retired to his room.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"1adb"}},
{"insert":"　　His wife was in bed, but she was not asleep.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3075"}},
{"insert":"　　When she heard her husband's step she turned over and said to him:--","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"97f5"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Do you know, I'm going to turn Cosette out of doors to-morrow.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a11b"}},
{"insert":"　　Thenardier replied coldly:--","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"e4a9"}},
{"insert":"　　\"How you do go on!\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"fc60"}},
{"insert":"　　They exchanged no further words, and a few moments later their candle was extinguished.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"107f"}},
{"insert":"　　As for the traveller, he had deposited his cudgel and his bundle in a corner.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"c694"}},
{"insert":"　　The landlord once gone, he threw himself into an arm-chair and remained for some time buried in thought. Then he removed his shoes, took one of the two candles, blew out the other, opened the door, and quitted the room, gazing about him like a person who is in search of something. He traversed a corridor and came upon a staircase.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"63fb"}},
{"insert":"　　There he heard a very faint and gentle sound like the breathing of a child. He followed this sound, and came to a sort of triangular recess built under the staircase, or rather formed by the staircase itself. This recess was nothing else than the space under the steps. There, in the midst of all sorts of old papers and potsherds, among dust and spiders' webs, was a bed--if one can call by the name of bed a straw pallet so full of holes as to display the straw, and a coverlet so tattered as to show the pallet.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"0dc5"}},
{"insert":"　　No sheets. This was placed on the floor.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"c61c"}},
{"insert":"　　In this bed Cosette was sleeping.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"dab2"}},
{"insert":"　　The man approached and gazed down upon her.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"6a01"}},
{"insert":"　　Cosette was in a profound sleep; she was fully dressed.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"9c98"}},
{"insert":"　　In the winter she did not undress, in order that she might not be so cold.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"fffe"}},
{"insert":"　　Against her breast was pressed the doll, whose large eyes, wide open, glittered in the dark.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"f3f6"}},
{"insert":"　　From time to time she gave vent to a deep sigh as though she were on the point of waking, and she strained the doll almost convulsively in her arms.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"c693"}},
{"insert":"　　Beside her bed there was only one of her wooden shoes.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"995f"}},
{"insert":"　　A door which stood open near Cosette's pallet permitted a view of a rather large, dark room.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5dcc"}},
{"insert":"　　The stranger stepped into it. At the further extremity, through a glass door, he saw two small, very white beds.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"6a44"}},
{"insert":"　　They belonged to Eponine and Azelma. Behind these beds, and half hidden, stood an uncurtained wicker cradle, in which the little boy who had cried all the evening lay asleep.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5475"}},
{"insert":"　　The stranger conjectured that this chamber connected with that of the Thenardier pair.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"37c0"}},
{"insert":"　　He was on the point of retreating when his eye fell upon the fireplace--one of those vast tavern chimneys where there is always so little fire when there is any fire at all, and which are so cold to look at.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"dcf0"}},
{"insert":"　　There was no fire in this one, there was not even ashes; but there was something which attracted the stranger's gaze, nevertheless.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"da2f"}},
{"insert":"　　It was two tiny children's shoes, coquettish in shape and unequal in size.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ac4f"}},
{"insert":"　　The traveller recalled the graceful and immemorial custom in accordance with which children place their shoes in the chimney on Christmas eve, there to await in the darkness some sparkling gift from their good fairy. Eponine and Azelma had taken care not to omit this, and each of them had set one of her shoes on the hearth.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"751e"}},
{"insert":"　　The traveller bent over them.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"51c4"}},
{"insert":"　　The fairy, that is to say, their mother, had already paid her visit, and in each he saw a brand-new and shining ten-sou piece.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ee06"}},
{"insert":"　　The man straightened himself up, and was on the point of withdrawing, when far in, in the darkest corner of the hearth, he caught sight of another object.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"1161"}},
{"insert":"　　He looked at it, and recognized a wooden shoe, a frightful shoe of the coarsest description, half dilapidated and all covered with ashes and dried mud.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"9e87"}},
{"insert":"　　It was Cosette's sabot. Cosette, with that touching trust of childhood, which can always be deceived yet never discouraged, had placed her shoe on the hearth-stone also.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"c44a"}},
{"insert":"　　Hope in a child who has never known anything but despair is a sweet and touching thing.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"da11"}},
{"insert":"　　There was nothing in this wooden shoe.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"0d81"}},
{"insert":"　　The stranger fumbled in his waistcoat, bent over and placed a louis d'or in Cosette's shoe.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"541c"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"7d5e"}},
{"insert":"　　 On the following morning, two hours at least before day-break, Thenardier, seated beside a candle in the public room of the tavern, pen in hand, was making out the bill for the traveller with the yellow coat.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"2853"}},
{"insert":"　　His wife, standing beside him, and half bent over him, was following him with her eyes.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a011"}},
{"insert":"　　They exchanged not a word.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"9a75"}},
{"insert":"　　On the one hand, there was profound meditation, on the other, the religious admiration with which one watches the birth and development of a marvel of the human mind.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"484c"}},
{"insert":"　　A noise was audible in the house; it was the Lark sweeping the stairs.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"04cc"}},
{"insert":"　　After the lapse of a good quarter of an hour, and some erasures, Thenardier produced the following masterpiece:-- ","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"96cc"}},
{"insert":"　　BILL OF THE GENTLEMAN IN No. 1.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"Total . . . . . . 23 francs.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"f708"}},
{"insert":"　　 Service was written servisse.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5d6d"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Twenty-three francs!\" cried the woman, with an enthusiasm which was mingled with some hesitation.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a4d1"}},
{"insert":"　　Like all great artists, Thenardier was dissatisfied.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"f232"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Peuh!\" he exclaimed.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"1f3a"}},
{"insert":"　　It was the accent of Castlereagh auditing France's bill at the Congress of Vienna.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"7803"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Monsieur Thenardier, you are right; he certainly owes that,\" murmured the wife, who was thinking of the doll bestowed on Cosette in the presence of her daughters.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5623"}},
{"insert":"　　\"It is just, but it is too much. He will not pay it.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"2e31"}},
{"insert":"　　Thenardier laughed coldly, as usual, and said:--","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"0479"}},
{"insert":"　　\"He will pay.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"21b9"}},
{"insert":"　　This laugh was the supreme assertion of certainty and authority. That which was asserted in this manner must needs be so.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5f9e"}},
{"insert":"　　His wife did not insist.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"8108"}},
{"insert":"　　She set about arranging the table; her husband paced the room. A moment later he added:--","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"7e3f"}},
{"insert":"　　\"I owe full fifteen hundred francs!\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"7a20"}},
{"insert":"　　He went and seated himself in the chimney-corner, meditating, with his feet among the warm ashes.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"94d6"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Ah! by the way,\" resumed his wife, \"you don't forget that I'm going to turn Cosette out of doors to-day? The monster!","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"7d80"}},
{"insert":"　　She breaks my heart with that doll of hers!","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　I'd rather marry Louis XVIII. than keep her another day in the house!\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"c426"}},
{"insert":"　　Thenardier lighted his pipe, and replied between two puffs:--","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"499c"}},
{"insert":"　　\"You will hand that bill to the man.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a3f0"}},
{"insert":"　　Then he went out.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"e298"}},
{"insert":"　　Hardly had he left the room when the traveller entered.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"dbd9"}},
{"insert":"　　Thenardier instantly reappeared behind him and remained motionless in the half-open door, visible only to his wife.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"dc54"}},
{"insert":"　　The yellow man carried his bundle and his cudgel in his hand.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3742"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Up so early?\" said Madame Thenardier; \"is Monsieur leaving us already?\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5c41"}},
{"insert":"　　As she spoke thus, she was twisting the bill about in her hands with an embarrassed air, and making creases in it with her nails. Her hard face presented a shade which was not habitual with it,-- timidity and scruples.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5a34"}},
{"insert":"　　To present such a bill to a man who had so completely the air \"of a poor wretch\" seemed difficult to her.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"520d"}},
{"insert":"　　The traveller appeared to be preoccupied and absent-minded. He replied:--","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"e072"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Yes, Madame, I am going.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"af60"}},
{"insert":"　　\"So Monsieur has no business in Montfermeil?\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"c277"}},
{"insert":"　　\"No, I was passing through.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"7838"}},
{"insert":"　　That is all.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"b2f8"}},
{"insert":"　　What do I owe you, Madame,\" he added.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3d79"}},
{"insert":"　　The Thenardier silently handed him the folded bill.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"01b0"}},
{"insert":"　　The man unfolded the paper and glanced at it; but his thoughts were evidentl","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"y elsewhere.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"c439"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Madame,\" he resumed, \"is business good here in Montfermeil?\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"da1b"}},
{"insert":"　　\"So so, Monsieur,\" replied the Thenardier, stupefied at not witnessing another sort of explosion.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"667d"}},
{"insert":"　　She continued, in a dreary and lamentable tone:--","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"e255"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Oh!","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3938"}},
{"insert":"　　Monsieur, times are so hard! and then, we have so few bourgeois in the neighborhood!","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"8adc"}},
{"insert":"　　All the people are poor, you see.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"0afb"}},
{"insert":"　　If we had not, now and then, some rich and generous travellers like Monsieur, we should not get along at all.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ea9b"}},
{"insert":"　　We have so many expenses.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"75f5"}},
{"insert":"　　Just see, that child is costing us our very eyes.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"43e1"}},
{"insert":"　　\"What child?\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5b49"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Why, the little one, you know!","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"bbb4"}},
{"insert":"　　Cosette--the Lark, as she is called hereabouts!\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"9af5"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Ah!\" said the man.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"18a2"}},
{"insert":"　　She went on:--","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"22b4"}},
{"insert":"　　\"How stupid these peasants are with their nicknames!","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"64dd"}},
{"insert":"　　She has more the air of a bat than of a lark.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"d226"}},
{"insert":"　　You see, sir, we do not ask charity, and we cannot bestow it.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"c91f"}},
{"insert":"　　We earn nothing and we have to pay out a great deal.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"baf5"}},
{"insert":"　　The license, the imposts, the door and window tax, the hundredths!","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a497"}},
{"insert":"　　Monsieur is aware that the government demands a terrible deal of money.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ed22"}},
{"insert":"　　And then, I have my daughters. I have no need to bring up other people's children.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"db75"}},
{"insert":"　　The man resumed, in that voice which he strove to render indifferent, and in which there lingered a tremor:--","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"784e"}},
{"insert":"　　\"What if one were to rid you of her?\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"2ddb"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Who?","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"de8c"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"9505"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Yes.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"71c2"}},
{"insert":"　　The landlady's red and violent face brightened up hideously.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"cbd5"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Ah! sir, my dear sir, take her, keep her, lead her off, carry her away, sugar her, stuff her with truffles, drink her, eat her, and the blessings of the good holy Virgin and of all the saints of paradise be upon you!\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ecc8"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Agreed.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"7af0"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Really!","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"8e6e"}},
{"insert":"　　You will take her away?\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"9479"}},
{"insert":"　　\"I will take her away.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"8e91"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Immediately?\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5e21"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Immediately.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　Call the child.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5b28"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Cosette!\" screamed the Thenardier.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ac0f"}},
{"insert":"　　\"In the meantime,\" pursued the man, \"I will pay you what I owe you. How much is it?\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"0b52"}},
{"insert":"　　He cast a glance on the bill, and could not restrain a start of surprise:--","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"2e13"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Twenty-three francs!\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"7007"}},
{"insert":"　　He looked at the landlady, and repeated:--","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"c2ae"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Twenty-three francs?\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a048"}},
{"insert":"　　There was in the enunciation of these words, thus repeated, an accent between an exclamation and an interrogation point.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"8869"}},
{"insert":"　　The Thenardier had had time to prepare herself for the shock. She replied, with assurance:--","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4d03"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Good gracious, yes, sir, it is twenty-three francs.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"c47f"}},
{"insert":"　　The stranger laid five five-franc pieces on the table.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"da05"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Go and get the child,\" said he.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"87eb"}},
{"insert":"　　At that moment Thenardier advanced to the middle of the room, and said:--","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"d13f"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Monsieur owes twenty-six sous.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"42f8"}},

{"insert":"　　As soon as they were alone, Thenardier offered the traveller a chair. The traveller seated himself; Thenardier remained standing, and his face assumed a singular expression of good-fellowship and simplicity.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　I saw her first when she was a tiny thing.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a6d1"}},
{"insert":"　　It is true that she costs us money; it is true that she has her faults; it is true that we are not rich; it is true that I have paid out over four hundred francs for drugs for just one of her illnesses!","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"7f19"}},
{"insert":"　　But one must do something for the good God's sake.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"774f"}},
{"insert":"　　She has neither father nor mother. I have brought her up.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　I have bread enough for her and for myself. In truth, I think a great deal of that child.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"efff"}},
{"insert":"　　You understand, one conceives an affection for a person; I am a good sort of a beast, I am; I do not reason; I love that little girl; my wife is quick-tempered, but she loves her also.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"7da8"}},
{"insert":"　　You see, she is just the same as our own child.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　But one must find out that.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"072b"}},
{"insert":"　　You understand: suppose that I were to let her go and to sacrifice myself, I should like to know what becomes of her; I should not wish to lose sight of her; I should like to know with whom she is living, so that I could go to see her from time to time; so that she may know that her good foster-father is alive, that he is watching over her. In short, there are things which are not possible.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　I do not even know your name.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"adf4"}},
{"insert":"　　The stranger, still surveying him with that gaze which penetrates, as the saying goes, to the very depths of the conscience, replied in a grave, firm voice:--","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　\"Monsieur Thenardier, one does not require a passport to travel five leagues from Paris.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　I break the thread which binds her foot, and she departs.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"404d"}},
{"insert":"　　Yes or no?\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"eae4"}},
{"insert":"　　Since geniuses, like demons, recognize the presence of a superior God by certain signs, Thenardier comprehended that he had to deal with a very strong person.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"41a8"}},
{"insert":"　　It was like an intuition; he comprehended it with his clear and sagacious promptitude.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"9571"}},
{"insert":"　　While drinking with the carters, smoking, and singing coarse songs on the preceding evening, he had devoted the whole of the time to observing the stranger, watching him like a cat, and studying him like a mathematician. He had watched him, both on his own account, for the pleasure of the thing, and through instinct, and had spied upon him as though he had been paid for so doing.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"b2e3"}},
{"insert":"　　Not a movement, not a gesture, on the part of the man in the yellow great-coat had escaped him. Even before the stranger had so clearly manifested his interest in Cosette, Thenardier had divined his purpose.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"eb07"}},
{"insert":"　　He had caught the old man's deep glances returning constantly to the child. Who was this man?","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"7d13"}},
{"insert":"　　Why this interest?","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"e01a"}},
{"insert":"　　Why this hideous costume, when he had so much money in his purse?","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"e6bf"}},
{"insert":"　　Questions which he put to himself without being able to solve them, and which irritated him. He had pondered it all night long.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"7d38"}},
{"insert":"　　He could not be Cosette's father. Was he her grandfather?","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"cfed"}},
{"insert":"　　Then why not make himself known at once? When one has a right, one asserts it.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"d872"}},
{"insert":"　　This man evidently had no right over Cosette.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"b813"}},
{"insert":"　　What was it, then?","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"31f2"}},
{"insert":"　　Thenardier lost himself in conjectures.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"2487"}},
{"insert":"　　He caught glimpses of everything, but he saw nothing. Be that as it may, on entering into conversation with the man, sure that there was some secret in the case, that the latter had some interest in remaining in the shadow, he felt himself strong; when he perceived from the stranger's clear and firm retort, that this mysterious personage was mysterious in so simple a way, he became conscious that he was weak.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"9e7e"}},
{"insert":"　　He had expected nothing of the sort.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"8a39"}},
{"insert":"　　His conjectures were put to the rout.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"d5c8"}},
{"insert":"　　He rallied his ideas.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"240b"}},
{"insert":"　　He weighed everything in the space of a second. Thenardier was one of those men who take in a situation at a glance. He decided that the moment had arrived for proceeding straightforward, and quickly at that.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"2490"}},
{"insert":"　　He did as great leaders do at the decisive moment, which they know that they alone recognize; he abruptly unmasked his batteries.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"882e"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Sir,\" said he, \"I am in need of fifteen hundred francs.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"0480"}},
{"insert":"　　The stranger took from his side pocket an old pocketbook of black leather, opened it, drew out three bank-bills, which he laid on the table. Then he placed his large thumb on the notes and said to the inn-keeper:--","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"06e8"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Go and fetch Cosette.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　While this was taking place, what had Cosette been doing?","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"7fa0"}},
{"insert":"　　On waking up, Cosette had run to get her shoe.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"56d8"}},
{"insert":"　　In it she had found the gold piece.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"47cc"}},
{"insert":"　　It was not a Napoleon; it was one of those perfectly new twenty-franc pieces of the Restoration, on whose effigy the little Prussian queue had replaced the laurel wreath. Cosette was dazzled.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"894d"}},
{"insert":"　　Her destiny began to intoxicate her. She did not know what a gold piece was; she had never seen one; she hid it quickly in her pocket, as though she had stolen it. Still, she felt that it really was hers; she guessed whence her gift had come, but the joy which she experienced was full of fear. She was happy; above all she was stupefied.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3814"}},
{"insert":"　　Such magnificent and beautiful things did not appear real.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　The doll frightened her, the gold piece frightened her.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　The stranger alone did not frighten her. On the contrary, he reassured her.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5031"}},
{"insert":"　　Ever since the preceding evening, amid all her amazement, even in her sleep, she had been thinking in her little childish mind of that man who seemed to be so poor and so sad, and who was so rich and so kind.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a124"}},
{"insert":"　　Everything had changed for her since she had met that good man in the forest. Cosette, less happy than the most insignificant swallow of heaven, had never known what it was to take refuge under a mother's shadow and under a wing.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"84bb"}},
{"insert":"　　For the last five years, that is to say, as far back as her memory ran, the poor child had shivered and trembled. She had always been exposed completely naked to the sharp wind of adversity; now it seemed to her she was clothed.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"0af9"}},
{"insert":"　　Formerly her soul had seemed cold, now it was warm.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3d9e"}},
{"insert":"　　Cosette was no longer afraid of the Thenardier.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"849a"}},
{"insert":"　　She was no longer alone; there was some one there.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4af9"}},
{"insert":"　　She hastily set about her regular morning duties.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"6b59"}},
{"insert":"　　That louis, which she had about her, in the very apron pocket whence the fifteen-sou piece had fallen on the night before, distracted her thoughts. She dared not touch it, but she spent five minutes in gazing at it, with her tongue hanging out, if the truth must be told.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"678a"}},
{"insert":"　　As she swept the staircase, she paused, remained standing there motionless, forgetful of her broom and of the entire universe, occupied in gazing at that star which was blazing at the bottom of her pocket.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3932"}},
{"insert":"　　It was during one of these periods of contemplation that the Thenardier joined her.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　An instant later Cosette entered the public room.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"6fe7"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"2be8"}},
{"insert":"　　It was no longer solitude, for there were passers-by; it was not the country, for there were houses and streets; it was not the city, for the streets had ruts like highways, and the grass grew in them; it was not a village, the houses were too lofty.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5910"}},

There, near a factory, and between two garden walls, there could be seen, at that epoch, a mean building, which, at the first glance, seemed as small as a thatched hovel, and which was, in reality, as large as a cathedral. It presented its side and gable to the public road; hence its apparent diminutiveness.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

It seems as though, around these great centres of the movements of a people, the earth, full of germs, trembled and yawned, to engulf the ancient dwellings of men and to allow new ones to spring forth, at the rattle of these powerful machines, at the breath of these monstrous horses of civilization which devour coal and vomit fire. The old houses crumble and new ones rise.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　At daybreak, just as he was falling into a doze through fatigue, he was awakened by the creaking of a door which opened on some attic at the end of the corridor, then he heard the same masculine footstep which had ascended the stairs on the preceding evening.

Petit-Picpus had, as we have just mentioned, a Y of streets, formed by the Rue du Chemin-Vert-Saint-Antoine, which spread out in two branches, taking on the left the name of Little Picpus Street, and on the right the name of the Rue Polonceau. The two limbs of the Y were connected at the apex as by a bar; this bar was called Rue Droit-Mur. The Rue Polonceau ended there; Rue Petit-Picpus passed on, and ascended towards the Lenoir market. A person coming from the Seine reached the extremity of the Rue Polonceau, and had on his right the Rue Droit-Mur, turning abruptly at a right angle, in front of him the wall of that street, and on his right a truncated prolongation of the Rue Droit-Mur, which had no issue and was called the Cul-de-Sac Genrot.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　In the imminent peril in which Jean Valjean found himself, this sombre building had about it a solitary and uninhabited look which tempted him.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　He ran his eyes rapidly over it; he said to himself, that if he could contrive to get inside it, he might save himself. First he conceived an idea, then a hope.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"6844"}},
{"insert":"　　In the central portion of the front of this building, on the Rue Droit-Mur side, there were at all the windows of the different stories ancient cistern pipes of lead.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　This odd espalier, with its branches of lead and iron, was the first thing that struck Jean Valjean.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"b964"}},
{"insert":"　　He seated Cosette with her back against a stone post, with an injunction to be silent, and ran to the spot where the conduit touched the pavement. Perhaps there was some way of climbing up by it and entering the house. But the pipe was dilapidated and past service, and hardly hung to its fastenings.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"6620"}},
{"insert":"　　Moreover, all the windows of this silent dwelling were grated with heavy iron bars, even the attic windows in the roof.

{"insert":"　　As we have just explained, he was concealed from all eyes, no matter from which direction they were approaching; besides this, he was in the shadow. Finally, there were two doors; perhaps they might be forced. The wall above which he saw the linden-tree and the ivy evidently abutted on a garden where he could, at least, hide himself, although there were as yet no leaves on the trees, and spend the remainder of the night.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　On examining it he found that the door was not a door; it had neither hinges, cross-bars, lock, nor fissure in the middle; the iron bands traversed it from side to side without any break.

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"0b7c"}},
{"insert":"　　He was forced to acknowledge with consternation that this apparent door was simply the wooden decoration of a building against which it was placed. It was easy to tear off a plank; but then, one found one's self face to face with a wall.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　Among his other resources, thanks to his numerous escapes from the prison at Toulon, he was, as it will be remembered, a past master in the incredible art of crawling up without ladder or climbing-irons, by sheer muscular force, by leaning on the nape of his neck, his shoulders, his hips, and his knees, by helping himself on the rare projections of the stone, in the right angle of a wall, as high as the sixth story, if need be; an art which has rendered so celebrated and so alarming that corner of the wall of the Conciergerie of Paris by which Battemolle, condemned to death, made his escape twenty years ago.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　The angle which it formed with the gable of the large building was filled, at its lower extremity, by a mass of masonry of a triangular shape, probably intended to preserve that too convenient corner from the rubbish of those dirty creatures called the passers-by.

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3869"}},
{"insert":"　　At that epoch there were no gas-jets in the streets of Paris. At nightfall lanterns placed at regular distances were lighted; they were ascended and descended by means of a rope, which traversed the street from side to side, and was adjusted in a groove of the post. The pulley over which this rope ran was fastened underneath the lantern in a little iron box, the key to which was kept by the lamp-lighter, and the rope itself was protected by a metal case.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"6f76"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ac9d"}},

{"insert":"　　Any other child than she would have given vent to loud shrieks long before.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　Then, without haste, but without making a useless movement, with firm and curt precision, the more remarkable at a moment when the patrol and Javert might come upon him at any moment, he undid his cravat, passed it round Cosette's body under the armpits, taking care that it should not hurt the child, fastened this cravat to one end of the rope, by means of that knot which seafaring men call a \"swallow knot,\" took the other end of the rope in his teeth, pulled off his shoes and stockings, which he threw over the wall, stepped upon the mass of masonry, and began to raise himself in the angle of the wall and the gable with as much solidity and certainty as though he had the rounds of a ladder under his feet and elbows. Half a minute had not elapsed when he was resting on his knees on the wall.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"2629"}},
{"insert":"　　This garden was oblong in shape, with an alley of large poplars at the further end, tolerably tall forest trees in the corners, and an unshaded space in the centre, where could be seen a very large, solitary tree, then several fruit-trees, gnarled and bristling like bushes, beds of vegetables, a melon patch, whose glass frames sparkled in the moonlight, and an old well. Here and there stood stone benches which seemed black with moss. The alleys were bordered with gloomy and very erect little shrubs.

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"611f"}},
{"insert":"　　Jean Valjean had beside him the building whose roof had served him as a means of descent, a pile of fagots, and, behind the fagots, directly against the wall, a stone statue, whose mutilated face was no longer anything more than a shapeless mask which loomed vaguely through the gloom.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"bde5"}},
{"insert":"　　The large building of the Rue Droit-Mur, which had a wing on the Rue Petit-Picpus, turned two facades, at right angles, towards this garden. These interior facades were even more tragic than the exterior. All the windows were grated.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"66c4"}},
{"insert":"　　Jean Valjean's first care had been to get hold of his shoes and put them on again, then to step under the shed with Cosette.

{"insert":"　　 The night wind had risen, which indicated that it must be between one and two o'clock in the morning.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a524"}},
{"insert":"　　Poor Cosette said nothing. As she had seated herself beside him and leaned her head against him, Jean Valjean had fancied that she was asleep.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ed59"}},
{"insert":"　　He bent down and looked at her.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"291b"}},
{"insert":"　　Cosette's eyes were wide open, and her thoughtful air pained Jean Valjean.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"9bcb"}},
{"insert":"　　She was still trembling.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"1c06"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Are you sleepy?\" said Jean Valjean.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3c49"}},
{"insert":"　　\"I am very cold,\" she replied.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"38ec"}},
{"insert":"　　A moment later she resumed:--","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ca63"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Is she still there?\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"124a"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"e4a6"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Madame Thenardier.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"e0c1"}},
{"insert":"　　Jean Valjean had already forgotten the means which he had employed to make Cosette keep silent.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"8510"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Ah!\" said he, \"she is gone.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"291a"}},
{"insert":"　　You need fear nothing further.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a6bf"}},
{"insert":"　　The child sighed as though a load had been lifted from her breast.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ce08"}},
{"insert":"　　The ground was damp, the shed open on all sides, the breeze grew more keen every instant.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"97c8"}},
{"insert":"　　The goodman took off his coat and wrapped it round Cosette.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"eaa3"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Are you less cold now?\" said he.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a398"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Oh, yes, father.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ee14"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Well, wait for me a moment.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"7467"}},
{"insert":"　　I will soon be back.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"6092"}},
{"insert":"　　He quitted the ruin and crept along the large building, seeking a better shelter.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3358"}},
{"insert":"　　He came across doors, but they were closed. There were bars at all the windows of the ground floor.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"79c6"}},
{"insert":"　　Just after he had turned the inner angle of the edifice, he observed that he was coming to some arched windows, where he perceived a light. He stood on tiptoe and peeped through one of these windows. They all opened on a tolerably vast hall, paved with large flagstones, cut up by arcades and pillars, where only a tiny light and great shadows were visible.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"183e"}},
{"insert":"　　The light came from a taper which was burning in one corner.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"05d0"}},
{"insert":"　　The apartment was deserted, and nothing was stirring in it.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"f000"}},
{"insert":"　　Nevertheless, by dint of gazing intently he thought he perceived on the ground something which appeared to be covered with a winding-sheet, and which resembled a human form. This form was lying face downward, flat on the pavement, with the arms extended in the form of a cross, in the immobility of death. One would have said, judging from a sort of serpent which undulated over the floor, that this sinister form had a rope round its neck.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"7752"}},
{"insert":"　　The whole chamber was bathed in that mist of places which are sparely illuminated, which adds to horror.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"9212"}},
{"insert":"　　Jean Valjean often said afterwards, that, although many funereal spectres had crossed his path in life, he had never beheld anything more blood-curdling and terrible than that enigmatical form accomplishing some inexplicable mystery in that gloomy place, and beheld thus at night.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"6180"}},
{"insert":"　　It was alarming to suppose that that thing was perhaps dead; and still more alarming to think that it was perhaps alive.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"56ea"}},
{"insert":"　　He had the courage to plaster his face to the glass, and to watch whether the thing would move.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"fb16"}},
{"insert":"　　In spite of his remaining thus what seemed to him a very long time, the outstretched form made no movement. All at once he felt himself overpowered by an inexpressible terror, and he fled.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"cdab"}},
{"insert":"　　He began to run towards the shed, not daring to look behind him.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"42fd"}},
{"insert":"　　It seemed to him, that if he turned his head, he should see that form following him with great strides and waving its arms.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"7a8c"}},
{"insert":"　　He reached the ruin all out of breath.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"8d28"}},
{"insert":"　　His knees were giving way beneath him; the perspiration was pouring from him.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ccae"}},
{"insert":"　　Where was he?","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"8bcc"}},
{"insert":"　　Who could ever have imagined anything like that sort of sepulchre in the midst of Paris!","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"304f"}},
{"insert":"　　What was this strange house? An edifice full of nocturnal mystery, calling to souls through the darkness with the voice of angels, and when they came, offering them abruptly that terrible vision; promising to open the radiant portals of heaven, and then opening the horrible gates of the tomb!","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"caf0"}},
{"insert":"　　And it actually was an edifice, a house, which bore a number on the street! It was not a dream!","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"adf8"}},
{"insert":"　　He had to touch the stones to convince himself that such was the fact.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"39e8"}},
{"insert":"　　Cold, anxiety, uneasiness, the emotions of the night, had given him a genuine fever, and all these ideas were clashing together in his brain.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"068e"}},
{"insert":"　　He stepped up to Cosette.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3b4d"}},
{"insert":"　　She was asleep.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　THE ENIGMA BECOMES DOUBLY MYSTERIOUS","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"247e"}},
{"insert":"　　 The child had laid her head on a stone and fallen asleep.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"dcb8"}},
{"insert":"　　He sat down beside her and began to think.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"228b"}},
{"insert":"　　Little by little, as he gazed at her, he grew calm and regained possession of his freedom of mind.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"15e9"}},
{"insert":"　　He clearly perceived this truth, the foundation of his life henceforth, that so long as she was there, so long as he had her near him, he should need nothing except for her, he should fear nothing except for her.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"2e3c"}},
{"insert":"　　He was not even conscious that he was very cold, since he had taken off his coat to cover her.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"86ea"}},
{"insert":"　　Nevertheless, athwart this revery into which he had fallen he had heard for some time a peculiar noise.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"0aab"}},
{"insert":"　　It was like the tinkling of a bell.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"f5cf"}},
{"insert":"　　This sound proceeded from the garden.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"0d57"}},
{"insert":"　　It could be heard distinctly though faintly.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"1b2f"}},
{"insert":"　　It resembled the faint, vague music produced by the bells of cattle at night in the pastures.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"296d"}},
{"insert":"　　This noise made Valjean turn round.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4880"}},
{"insert":"　　He looked and saw that there was some one in the garden.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3f03"}},
{"insert":"　　A being resembling a man was walking amid the bell-glasses of the melon beds, rising, stooping, halting, with regular movements, as though he were dragging or spreading out something on the ground. This person appeared to limp.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3d12"}},
{"insert":"　　Jean Valjean shuddered with the continual tremor of the unhappy. For them everything is hostile and suspicious.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"0da0"}},
{"insert":"　　They distrust the day because it enables people to see them, and the night because it aids in surprising them.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"9035"}},
{"insert":"　　A little while before he had shivered because the garden was deserted, and now he shivered because there was some one there.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"d52b"}},
{"insert":"　　He fell back from chimerical terrors to real terrors.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"0d4c"}},
{"insert":"　　He said to himself that Javert and the spies had, perhaps, not taken their departure; that they had, no doubt, left people on the watch in the street; that if this man should discover him in the garden, he would cry out for help against thieves and deliver him up. He took the sleeping Cosette gently in his arms and carried her behind a heap of old furniture, which was out of use, in the most remote corner of the shed.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"017b"}},
{"insert":"　　Cosette did not stir.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"959f"}},
{"insert":"　　From that point he scrutinized the appearance of the being in the melon patch.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"d09f"}},
{"insert":"　　The strange thing about it was, that the sound of the bell followed each of this man's movements.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"7d67"}},
{"insert":"　　When the man approached, the sound approached; when the man retreated, the sound retreated; if he made any hasty gesture, a tremolo accompanied the gesture; when he halted, the sound ceased.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"318e"}},
{"insert":"　　It appeared evident that the bell was attached to that man; but what could that signify? Who was this man who had a bell suspended about him like a ram or an ox?","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a1a0"}},
{"insert":"　　As he put these questions to himself, he touched Cosette's hands. They were icy cold.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"8c51"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Ah! good God!\" he cried.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"8ed5"}},
{"insert":"　　He spoke to her in a low voice:--","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"d4b9"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Cosette!\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4bf9"}},
{"insert":"　　She did not open her eyes.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3796"}},
{"insert":"　　He shook her vigorously.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"1713"}},
{"insert":"　　She did not wake.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"71c7"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Is she dead?\" he said to himself, and sprang to his feet, quivering from head to foot.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"63af"}},
{"insert":"　　The most frightful thoughts rushed pell-mell through his mind. There are moments when hideous surmises assail us like a cohort of furies, and violently force the partitions of our brains. When those we love are in question, our prudence invents every sort of madness.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"d8d8"}},
{"insert":"　　He remembered that sleep in the open air on a cold night may be fatal.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a08e"}},
{"insert":"　　Cosette was pale, and had fallen at full length on the ground at his feet, without a movement.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"7e98"}},
{"insert":"　　He listened to her breathing:","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"edce"}},
{"insert":"　　she still breathed, but with a respiration which seemed to him weak and on the point of extinction.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5dde"}},
{"insert":"　　 How was he to warm her back to life?","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"8974"}},
{"insert":"　　How was he to rouse her? All that was not connected with this vanished from his thoughts. He rushed wildly from the ruin.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"f6ac"}},
{"insert":"　　It was absolutely necessary that Cosette should be in bed and beside a fire in less than a quarter of an hour.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"581e"}},
{"insert":"　　THE MAN WITH THE BELL","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"c8e3"}},
{"insert":"　　 He walked straight up to the man whom he saw in the garden. He had taken in his hand the roll of silver which was in the pocket of his waistcoat.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"b15e"}},
{"insert":"　　The man's head was bent down, and he did not see him approaching. In a few strides Jean Valjean stood beside him.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a86a"}},
{"insert":"　　Jean Valjean accosted him with the cry:--","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"44b0"}},
{"insert":"　　\"One hundred francs!\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"19d3"}},
{"insert":"　　The man gave a start and raised his eyes.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3fb5"}},
{"insert":"　　\"You can earn a hundred francs,\" went on Jean Valjean, \"if you will grant me shelter for this night.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5d2a"}},
{"insert":"　　The moon shone full upon Jean Valjean's terrified countenance.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"1fa9"}},
{"insert":"　　\"What! so it is you, Father Madeleine!\" said the man.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"003b"}},
{"insert":"　　That name, thus pronounced, at that obscure hour, in that unknown spot, by that strange man, made Jean Valjean start back.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"b570"}},
{"insert":"　　He had expected anything but that.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"067f"}},
{"insert":"　　The person who thus addressed him was a bent and lame old man, dressed almost like a peasant, who wore on his left knee a leather knee-cap, whence hung a moderately large bell.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"eb43"}},
{"insert":"　　His face, which was in the shadow, was not distinguishable.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"19c9"}},
{"insert":"　　However, the goodman had removed his cap, and exclaimed, trembling all over:--","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5f4a"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Ah, good God!","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4a8c"}},
{"insert":"　　How come you here, Father Madeleine?","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a3a9"}},
{"insert":"　　Where did you enter?","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"b024"}},
{"insert":"　　Dieu-Jesus! Did you fall from heaven?","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ac9d"}},
{"insert":"　　There is no trouble about that:","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"b043"}},
{"insert":"　　if ever you do fall, it will be from there. And what a state you are in!","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"1e5b"}},
{"insert":"　　You have no cravat; you have no hat; you have no coat!","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"02f0"}},
{"insert":"　　Do you know, you would have frightened any one who did not know you?","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　No coat!","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"87f2"}},
{"insert":"　　Lord God!","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"8dbf"}},
{"insert":"　　Are the saints going mad nowadays?","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"23e4"}},
{"insert":"　　But how did you get in here?\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"9779"}},
{"insert":"　　His words tumbled over each other.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a988"}},
{"insert":"　　The goodman talked with a rustic volubility, in which there was nothing alarming.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"c9b6"}},
{"insert":"　　All this was uttered with a mixture of stupefaction and naive kindliness.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"d6a5"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Who are you? and what house is this?\" demanded Jean Valjean.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"0368"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Ah! pardieu, this is too much!\" exclaimed the old man. \"I am the person for whom you got the place here, and this house is the one where you had me placed.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"c8ff"}},
{"insert":"　　What!","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"c79d"}},
{"insert":"　　You don't recognize me?\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"9df9"}},
{"insert":"　　\"No,\" said Jean Valjean; \"and how happens it that you know me?\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4c84"}},
{"insert":"　　\"You saved my life,\" said the man.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"89e3"}},
{"insert":"　　He turned.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"0769"}},
{"insert":"　　A ray of moonlight outlined his profile, and Jean Valjean recognized old Fauchelevent.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"d11d"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Ah!\" said Jean Valjean, \"so it is you?","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"58b2"}},
{"insert":"　　Yes, I recollect you.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3725"}},
{"insert":"　　\"That is very lucky,\" said the old man, in a reproachful tone.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"f951"}},
{"insert":"　　\"And what are you doing here?\" resumed Jean Valjean.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"0939"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Why, I am covering my melons, of course!\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"bda8"}},
{"insert":"　　In fact, at the moment when Jean Valjean accosted him, old Fauchelevent held in his hand the end of a straw mat which he was occupied in spreading over the melon bed.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ff29"}},
{"insert":"　　During the hour or thereabouts that he had been in the garden he had already spread out a number of them. It was this operation which had caused him to execute the peculiar movements observed from the shed by Jean Valjean.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"af00"}},
{"insert":"　　He continued:--","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"0126"}},
{"insert":"　　\"I said to myself, `The moon is bright:","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"eb59"}},
{"insert":"　　it is going to freeze. What if I were to put my melons into their greatcoats?'","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"1fcd"}},
{"insert":"　　And,\" he added, looking at Jean Valjean with a broad smile,--\"pardieu! you ought to have done the same!","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"b375"}},
{"insert":"　　But how do you come here?\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"514b"}},
{"insert":"　　Jean Valjean, finding himself known to this man, at least only under the name of Madeleine, thenceforth advanced only with caution. He multiplied his questions.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"13b3"}},
{"insert":"　　Strange to say, their roles seemed to be reversed.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"2921"}},
{"insert":"　　It was he, the intruder, who interrogated.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"7870"}},
{"insert":"　　\"And what is this bell which you wear on your knee?\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"7b07"}},
{"insert":"　　\"This,\" replied Fauchelevent, \"is so that I may be avoided.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\"What! so that you may be avoided?\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"7611"}},
{"insert":"　　Old Fauchelevent winked with an indescribable air.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a62b"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Ah, goodness! there are only women in this house--many young girls. It appears that I should be a dangerous person to meet.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5fb0"}},
{"insert":"　　When Jean Valjean, on the evening of the very day when Javert had arrested him beside Fantine's death-bed, had escaped from the town jail of M. sur M., the police had supposed that he had betaken himself to Paris.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"088e"}},
{"insert":"　　The police know it also, and it is in Paris that they seek what they have lost elsewhere. They sought the ex-mayor of M. sur M. Javert was summoned to Paris to throw light on their researches.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"cc7f"}},
{"insert":"　　Javert had, in fact, rendered powerful assistance in the recapture of Jean Valjean. Javert's zeal and intelligence on that occasion had been remarked by M. Chabouillet, secretary of the Prefecture under Comte Angles. M. Chabouillet, who had, moreover, already been Javert's patron, had the inspector of M. sur M. attached to the police force of Paris. There Javert rendered himself useful in divers and, though the word may seem strange for such services, honorable manners.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"f6da"}},
{"insert":"　　He no longer thought of Jean Valjean,--the wolf of to-day causes these dogs who are always on the chase to forget the wolf of yesterday,--when, in December, 1823, he read a newspaper, he who never read newspapers; but Javert, a monarchical man, had a desire to know the particulars of the triumphal entry of the \"Prince Generalissimo\" into Bayonne. Just as he was finishing the article, which interested him; a name, the name of Jean Valjean, attracted his attention at the bottom of a page.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"19bc"}},
{"insert":"　　The paper announced that the convict Jean Valjean was dead, and published the fact in such formal terms that Javert did not doubt it.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　He confined himself to the remark, \"That's a good entry.\" Then he threw aside the paper, and thought no more about it.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　Some time afterwards, it chanced that a police report was transmitted from the prefecture of the Seine-et-Oise to the prefecture of police in Paris, concerning the abduction of a child, which had taken place, under peculiar circumstances, as it was said, in the commune of Montfermeil.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a450"}},
{"insert":"　　A little girl of seven or eight years of age, the report said, who had been intrusted by her mother to an inn-keeper of that neighborhood, had been stolen by a stranger; this child answered to the name of Cosette, and was the daughter of a girl named Fantine, who had died in the hospital, it was not known where or when.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"0f00"}},
{"insert":"　　This report came under Javert's eye and set him to thinking.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"bf00"}},
{"insert":"　　The name of Fantine was well known to him.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"d211"}},
{"insert":"　　He remembered that Jean Valjean had made him, Javert, burst into laughter, by asking him for a respite of three days, for the purpose of going to fetch that creature's child.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4fcc"}},
{"insert":"　　He recalled the fact that Jean Valjean had been arrested in Paris at the very moment when he was stepping into the coach for Montfermeil.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"28e8"}},
{"insert":"　　Some signs had made him suspect at the time that this was the second occasion of his entering that coach, and that he had already, on the previous day, made an excursion to the neighborhood of that village, for he had not been seen in the village itself. What had he been intending to do in that region of Montfermeil? It could not even be surmised.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"c002"}},
{"insert":"　　Javert understood it now. Fantine's daughter was there.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4a41"}},
{"insert":"　　Jean Valjean was going there in search of her.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"d45e"}},
{"insert":"　　And now this child had been stolen by a stranger! Who could that stranger be?","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"8e6b"}},
{"insert":"　　But Jean Valjean was dead.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"8f8b"}},
{"insert":"　　Javert, without saying anything to anybody, took the coach from the Pewter Platter, Cul-de-Sac de la Planchette, and made a trip to Montfermeil.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"f361"}},
{"insert":"　　He expected to find a great deal of light on the subject there; he found a great deal of obscurity.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"d04a"}},
{"insert":"　　For the first few days the Thenardiers had chattered in their rage. The disappearance of the Lark had created a sensation in the village. He immediately obtained numerous versions of the story, which ended in the abduction of a child.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"659d"}},
{"insert":"　　Hence the police report.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"2a6a"}},
{"insert":"　　But their first vexation having passed off, Thenardier, with his wonderful instinct, had very quickly comprehended that it is never advisable to stir up the prosecutor of the Crown, and that his complaints with regard to the abduction of Cosette would have as their first result to fix upon himself, and upon many dark affairs which he had on hand, the glittering eye of justice.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"462a"}},
{"insert":"　　The last thing that owls desire is to have a candle brought to them.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"d8bc"}},
{"insert":"　　And in the first place, how explain the fifteen hundred francs which he had received? He turned squarely round, put a gag on his wife's mouth, and feigned astonishment when the stolen child was mentioned to him. He understood nothing about it; no doubt he had grumbled for awhile at having that dear little creature \"taken from him\" so hastily; he should have liked to keep her two or three days longer, out of tenderness; but her \"grandfather\" had come for her in the most natural way in the world.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"7054"}},
{"insert":"　　He added the \"grandfather,\" which produced a good effect.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ba33"}},
{"insert":"　　This was the story that Javert hit upon when he arrived at Montfermeil.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"718e"}},
{"insert":"　　The grandfather caused Jean Valjean to vanish.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"cf0e"}},
{"insert":"　　Nevertheless, Javert dropped a few questions, like plummets, into Thenardier's history.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"bcb0"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Who was that grandfather? and what was his name?\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"7887"}},
{"insert":"　　Thenardier replied with simplicity:","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"55fd"}},
{"insert":"　　\"He is a wealthy farmer. I saw his passport.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"0e07"}},
{"insert":"　　I think his name was M. Guillaume Lambert.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"e5c6"}},
{"insert":"　　Lambert is a respectable and extremely reassuring name. Thereupon Javert returned to Paris.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"8de1"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Jean Valjean is certainly dead,\" said he, \"and I am a ninny.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"35ac"}},
{"insert":"　　He had again begun to forget this history, when, in the course of March, 1824, he heard of a singular personage who dwelt in the parish of Saint-Medard and who had been surnamed \"the mendicant who gives alms.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"f29b"}},
{"insert":"　　This person, the story ran, was a man of means, whose name no one knew exactly, and who lived alone with a little girl of eight years, who knew nothing about herself, save that she had come from Montfermeil.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"51b0"}},
{"insert":"　　Montfermeil! that name was always coming up, and it made Javert prick up his ears.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5383"}},
{"insert":"　　An old beggar police spy, an ex-beadle, to whom this person had given alms, added a few more details.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"dfff"}},
{"insert":"　　This gentleman of property was very shy,-- never coming out except in the evening, speaking to no one, except, occasionally to the poor, and never allowing any one to approach him. He wore a horrible old yellow frock-coat, which was worth many millions, being all wadded with bank-bills. This piqued Javert's curiosity in a decided manner.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"0f00"}},
{"insert":"　　In order to get a close look at this fantastic gentleman without alarming him, he borrowed the beadle's outfit for a day, and the place where the old spy was in the habit of crouching every evening, whining orisons through his nose, and playing the spy under cover of prayer.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"b7b9"}},
{"insert":"　　\"The suspected individual\" did indeed approach Javert thus disguised, and bestow alms on him.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"c000"}},
{"insert":"　　At that moment Javert raised his head, and the shock which Jean Valjean received on recognizing Javert was equal to the one received by Javert when he thought he recognized Jean Valjean.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"9c7e"}},
{"insert":"　　However, the darkness might have misled him; Jean Valjean's death was official; Javert cherished very grave doubts; and when in doubt, Javert, the man of scruples, never laid a finger on any one's collar.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ba48"}},
{"insert":"　　He followed his man to the Gorbeau house, and got \"the old woman\" to talking, which was no difficult matter.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"1b79"}},
{"insert":"　　The old woman confirmed the fact regarding the coat lined with millions, and narrated to him the episode of the thousand-franc bill.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"1df8"}},
{"insert":"　　She had seen it! She had handled it!","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3c3f"}},
{"insert":"　　Javert hired a room; that evening he installed himself in it.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"db5b"}},
{"insert":"　　He came and listened at the mysterious lodger's door, hoping to catch the sound of his voice, but Jean Valjean saw his candle through the key-hole, and foiled the spy by keeping silent.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"032f"}},
{"insert":"　　On the following day Jean Valjean decamped; but the noise made by the fall of the five-franc piece was noticed by the old woman, who, hearing the rattling of coin, suspected that he might be intending to leave, and made haste to warn Javert.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"9b04"}},
{"insert":"　　At night, when Jean Valjean came out, Javert was waiting for him behind the trees of the boulevard with two men.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"c785"}},
{"insert":"　　Javert had demanded assistance at the Prefecture, but he had not mentioned the name of the individual whom he hoped to seize; that was his secret, and he had kept it for three reasons: in the first place, because the slightest indiscretion might put Jean Valjean on the alert; next, because, to lay hands on an ex-convict who had made his escape and was reputed dead, on a criminal whom justice had formerly classed forever as among malefactors of the most dangerous sort, was a magnificent success which the old members of the Parisian police would assuredly not leave to a new-comer like Javert, and he was afraid of being deprived of his convict; and lastly, because Javert, being an artist, had a taste for the unforeseen.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"2d7e"}},
{"insert":"　　He hated those well-heralded successes which are talked of long in advance and have had the bloom brushed off. He preferred to elaborate his masterpieces in the dark and to unveil them suddenly at the last.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"d593"}},
{"insert":"　　Javert had followed Jean Valjean from tree to tree, then from corner to corner of the street, and had not lost sight of him for a single instant; even at the moments when Jean Valjean believed himself to be the most secure Javert's eye had been on him. Why had not Javert arrested Jean Valjean?","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4280"}},
{"insert":"　　Because he was still in doubt.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"75de"}},
{"insert":"　　It must be remembered that at that epoch the police was not precisely at its ease; the free press embarrassed it; several arbitrary arrests denounced by the newspapers, had echoed even as far as the Chambers, and had rendered the Prefecture timid.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"e93e"}},
{"insert":"　　Interference with individual liberty was a grave matter.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"79fa"}},
{"insert":"　　The police agents were afraid of making a mistake; the prefect laid the blame on them; a mistake meant dismissal. The reader can imagine the effect which this brief paragraph, reproduced by twenty newspapers, would have caused in Paris: \"Yesterday, an aged grandfather, with white hair, a respectable and well-to-do gentleman, who was walking with his grandchild, aged eight, was arrested and conducted to the agency of the Prefecture as an escaped convict!\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4d53"}},
{"insert":"　　Let us repeat in addition that Javert had scruples of his own; injunctions of his conscience were added to the injunctions of the prefect.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"703b"}},
{"insert":"　　He was really in doubt.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"d614"}},
{"insert":"　　Jean Valjean turned his back on him and walked in the dark.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"968e"}},
{"insert":"　　Sadness, uneasiness, anxiety, depression, this fresh misfortune of being forced to flee by night, to seek a chance refuge in Paris for Cosette and himself, the necessity of regulating his pace to the pace of the child--all this, without his being aware of it, had altered Jean Valjean's walk, and impressed on his bearing such senility, that the police themselves, incarnate in the person of Javert, might, and did in fact, make a mistake.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"f403"}},
{"insert":"　　The impossibility of approaching too close, his costume of an emigre preceptor, the declaration of Thenardier which made a grandfather of him, and, finally, the belief in his death in prison, added still further to the uncertainty which gathered thick in Javert's mind.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"920e"}},
{"insert":"　　For an instant it occurred to him to make an abrupt demand for his papers; but if the man was not Jean Valjean, and if this man was not a good, honest old fellow living on his income, he was probably some merry blade deeply and cunningly implicated in the obscure web of Parisian misdeeds, some chief of a dangerous band, who gave alms to conceal his other talents, which was an old dodge. He had trusty fellows, accomplices' retreats in case of emergencies, in which he would, no doubt, take refuge.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"f9ef"}},
{"insert":"　　All these turns which he was making through the streets seemed to indicate that he was not a simple and honest man.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"159d"}},

{"insert":"　　\"Have you seen a man with a little girl?\" \"I made him pay two sous,\" replied the toll-keeper. Javert reached the bridge in season to see Jean Valjean traverse the small illuminated spot on the other side of the water, leading Cosette by the hand. He saw him enter the Rue du Chemin-Vert-Saint-Antoine; he remembered the Cul-de-Sac Genrot arranged there like a trap, and of the sole exit of the Rue Droit-Mur into the Rue Petit-Picpus. He made sure of his back burrows, as huntsmen say; he hastily despatched one of his agents, by a roundabout way, to guard that issue. A patrol which was returning to the Arsenal post having passed him, he made a requisition on it, and caused it to accompany him. In such games soldiers are aces.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"6432"}},
{"insert":"　　Nothing, half a century ago, more resembled every other carriage gate than the carriage gate of Number 62 Rue Petit-Picpus.

{"insert":"　　If one succeeded in passing the porter, which was not easy,-- which was even nearly impossible for every one, for there was an open sesame! which it was necessary to know,--if, the porter once passed, one entered a little vestibule on the right, on which opened a staircase shut in between two walls and so narrow that only one person could ascend it at a time, if one did not allow one's self to be alarmed by a daubing of canary yellow, with a dado of chocolate which clothed this staircase, if one ventured to ascend it, one crossed a first landing, then a second, and arrived on the first story at a corridor where the yellow wash and the chocolate-hued plinth pursued one with a peaceable persistency.

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"6bba"}},
{"insert":"　　The little green flowers of the nankin paper ran in a calm and orderly manner to those iron bars, without being startled or thrown into confusion by their funereal contact.

{"insert":"　　What you beheld was night, emptiness, shadows, a wintry mist mingled with a vapor from the tomb, a sort of terrible peace, a silence from which you could gather nothing, not even sighs, a gloom in which you could distinguish nothing, not even phantoms.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

They are clothed in black, with a guimpe, which, in accordance with the express command of Saint-Benoit, mounts to the chin. A robe of serge with large sleeves, a large woollen veil, the guimpe which mounts to the chin cut square on the breast, the band which descends over their brow to their eyes,--this is their dress.

The coulpe or peccavi, is made for a very small matter--a broken glass, a torn veil, an involuntary delay of a few seconds at an office, a false note in church, etc.; this suffices, and the coulpe is made. The coulpe is entirely spontaneous; it is the culpable person herself (the word is etymologically in its place here) who judges herself and inflicts it on herself.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

To this whole, let the reader add a courtyard, all sorts of varied angles formed by the interior buildings, prison walls, the long black line of roofs which bordered the other side of the Rue Polonceau for its sole perspective and neighborhood, and he will be able to form for himself a complete image of what the house of the Bernardines of the Petit-Picpus was forty years ago. This holy house had been built on the precise site of a famous tennis-ground of the fourteenth to the sixteenth century, which was called the \"tennis-ground of the eleven thousand devils.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

When a great personage, a marshal of France, a prince, a duke, and a peer, traversed a town in Burgundy or Champagne, the city fathers came out to harangue him and presented him with four silver gondolas into which they had poured four different sorts of wine.

While in hiding, M. Madeleine had selected the convent as a refuge, and it was quite simple that he should wish to remain there. But the inexplicable point, to which Fauchelevent returned constantly and over which he wearied his brain, was that M. Madeleine should be there, and that he should have that little girl with him.

{"insert":"　　But what a problem it was to manage to have him remain in the convent! Fauchelevent did not recoil in the face of this almost chimerical undertaking; this poor peasant of Picardy without any other ladder than his self-devotion, his good will, and a little of that old rustic cunning, on this occasion enlisted in the service of a generous enterprise, undertook to scale the difficulties of the cloister, and the steep escarpments of the rule of Saint-Benoit. Father Fauchelevent was an old man who had been an egoist all his life, and who, towards the end of his days, halt, infirm, with no interest left to him in the world, found it sweet to be grateful, and perceiving a generous action to be performed, flung himself upon it like a man, who at the moment when he is dying, should find close to his hand a glass of good wine which he had never tasted, and should swallow it with avidity. We may add, that the air which he had breathed for many years in this convent had destroyed all personality in him, and had ended by rendering a good action of some kind absolutely necessary to him.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"8b1a"}},

{"insert":"　　\"He talks almost like a gentleman with a hat.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"1908"}},
{"insert":"　　Fauchelevent belonged, in fact, to that species, which the impertinent and flippant vocabulary of the last century qualified as demi-bourgeois, demi-lout, and which the metaphors showered by the chateau upon the thatched cottage ticketed in the pigeon-hole of the plebeian:","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"b9ea"}},
{"insert":"　　rather rustic, rather citified; pepper and salt. Fauchelevent, though sorely tried and harshly used by fate, worn out, a sort of poor, threadbare old soul, was, nevertheless, an impulsive man, and extremely spontaneous in his actions; a precious quality which prevents one from ever being wicked. His defects and his vices, for he had some, were all superficial; in short, his physiognomy was of the kind which succeeds with an observer.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　At daybreak, Father Fauchelevent opened his eyes, after having done an enormous deal of thinking, and beheld M. Madeleine seated on his truss of straw, and watching Cosette's slumbers. Fauchelevent sat up and said:--","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　Jean Valjean fell into more and more profound thought.--\"This convent would be our salvation,\" he murmured.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"c943"}},
{"insert":"　　A certain clever ignorance constitutes a force; you do not distrust it, and you are caught by it. Fauchelevent had been a success during the something more than two years which he had passed in the convent.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　As he was at a distance from all those veiled women passing to and fro, he saw before him only an agitation of shadows.

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a32b"}},
{"insert":"　　He had applied himself to riddling out the significance of the different peals, and he had succeeded, so that this taciturn and enigmatical cloister possessed no secrets for him; the sphinx babbled all her secrets in his ear. Fauchelevent knew all and concealed all; that constituted his art. The whole convent thought him stupid.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　the porter, in the convent, and he knew the singularities of their parlor, and the grave-digger, at the cemetery, and he was acquainted with the peculiarities of their sepulture; in this way, he possessed a double light on the subject of these nuns, one as to their life, the other as to their death.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"37e3"}},
{"insert":"　　But he did not abuse his knowledge. The congregation thought a great deal of him.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"f754"}},
{"insert":"　　The goodman, with the assurance of a person who feels that he is appreciated, entered into a rather diffuse and very deep rustic harangue to the reverend prioress.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a3a4"}},
{"insert":"　　He talked a long time about his age, his infirmities, the surcharge of years counting double for him henceforth, of the increasing demands of his work, of the great size of the garden, of nights which must be passed, like the last, for instance, when he had been obliged to put straw mats over the melon beds, because of the moon, and he wound up as follows: \"That he had a brother\"--(the prioress made a movement),--\"a brother no longer young\"--(a second movement on the part of the prioress, but one expressive of reassurance),--\"that, if he might be permitted, this brother would come and live with him and help him, that he was an excellent gardener, that the community would receive from him good service, better than his own; that, otherwise, if his brother were not admitted, as he, the elder, felt that his health was broken and that he was insufficient for the work, he should be obliged, greatly to his regret, to go away; and that his brother had a little daughter whom he would bring with him, who might be reared for God in the house, and who might, who knows, become a nun some day.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　She trembled to such a degree that she wept.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ed0b"}},

Cosette had betrayed nothing of what she had seen and heard during the last two days.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"53dc"}},
{"insert":"　　She divined that they were passing through a crisis.

{"insert":"　　The porter, who had received his instructions, opened the little servant's door which connected the courtyard with the garden, and which could still be seen from the street twenty years ago, in the wall at the bottom of the court, which faced the carriage entrance.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　\"He answers well.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"1a58"}},
{"insert":"　　Jean Valjean had not uttered a single word.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"e1a9"}},
{"insert":"　　The prioress looked attentively at Cosette, and said half aloud to the vocal mother:--","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　\"She will grow up ugly.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"68d0"}},
{"insert":"　　The two mothers consulted for a few moments in very low tones in the corner of the parlor, then the prioress turned round and said:--","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"785c"}},
{"insert":"　　At the extreme end of the garden, under the trees, two men, Fauvent and another man, were visible as they dug side by side.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　An enormous event.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　\"He is a brother of Father Fauvent.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ff38"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"8356"}},
{"insert":"　　His name was Ultime Fauchelevent.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"c55b"}},
{"insert":"　　The most powerful determining cause of his admission had been the prioress's observation upon Cosette:","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"787b"}},
{"insert":"　　\"She will grow up ugly.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"7335"}},
{"insert":"　　The prioress, that pronounced prognosticator, immediately took a fancy to Cosette and gave her a place in the school as a charity pupil.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"0073"}},
{"insert":"　　There is nothing that is not strictly logical about this.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"37db"}},
{"insert":"　　It is in vain that mirrors are banished from the convent, women are conscious of their faces; now, girls who are conscious of their beauty do not easily become nuns; the vocation being voluntary in inverse proportion to their good looks, more is to be hoped from the ugly than from the pretty.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"6b19"}},
{"insert":"　　Hence a lively taste for plain girls.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"2281"}},
{"insert":"　　The whole of this adventure increased the importance of good, old Fauchelevent; he won a triple success; in the eyes of Jean Valjean, whom he had saved and sheltered; in those of grave-digger Gribier, who said to himself:","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"f75b"}},
{"insert":"　　\"He spared me that fine\"; with the convent, which, being enabled, thanks to him, to retain the coffin of Mother Crucifixion under the altar, eluded Caesar and satisfied God. There was a coffin containing a body in the Petit-Picpus, and a coffin without a body in the Vaugirard cemetery, public order had no doubt been deeply disturbed thereby, but no one was aware of it.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"989d"}},
{"insert":"　　As for the convent, its gratitude to Fauchelevent was very great. Fauchelevent became the best of servitors and the most precious of gardeners.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3871"}},
{"insert":"　　Upon the occasion of the archbishop's next visit, the prioress recounted the affair to his Grace, making something of a confession at the same time, and yet boasting of her deed.

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"bb7d"}},
{"insert":"　　This admiration for Fauchelevent became widespread, for it made its way to Rome.

{"insert":"　　 At the epoch, nearly contemporary by the way, when the action of this book takes place, there was not, as there is to-day, a policeman at the corner of every street (a benefit which there is no time to discuss here); stray children abounded in Paris. The statistics give an average of two hundred and sixty homeless children picked up annually at that period, by the police patrols, in unenclosed lands, in houses in process of construction, and under the arches of the bridges.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"9d42"}},

{"insert":"　　While in any other great city the vagabond child is a lost man, while nearly everywhere the child left to itself is, in some sort, sacrificed and abandoned to a kind of fatal immersion in the public vices which devour in him honesty and conscience, the street boy of Paris, we insist on this point, however defaced and injured on the surface, is almost intact on the interior.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"d8a0"}},
{"insert":"　　It is a magnificent thing to put on record, and one which shines forth in the splendid probity of our popular revolutions, that a certain incorruptibility results from the idea which exists in the air of Paris, as salt exists in the water of the ocean.

{"insert":"　　In the civilization of the present day, incomplete as it still is, it is not a very abnormal thing to behold these fractured families pouring themselves out into the darkness, not knowing clearly what has become of their children, and allowing their own entrails to fall on the public highway.

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"8029"}},
{"insert":"　　Marius, in addition to his motives of political antipathy, was convinced that his father, the slasher, as M. Gillenormand called him on his amiable days, did not love him; this was evident, since he had abandoned him to others.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　She pointed to the door of a room on the ground-floor; he entered.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　In that room, which was lighted by a tallow candle standing on the chimney-piece, there were three men, one standing erect, another kneeling, and one lying at full length, on the floor in his shirt.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　The malady had grown worse.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"45e5"}},
{"insert":"　　On the very evening of Marius' arrival at Vernon, the colonel had had an attack of delirium; he had risen from his bed, in spite of the servant's efforts to prevent him, crying:","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a02d"}},
{"insert":"　　The son had also arrived too late.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"c86c"}},
{"insert":"　　By the dim light of the candle, a large tear could be distinguished on the pale and prostrate colonel's cheek, where it had trickled from his dead eye.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　The eye was extinguished, but the tear was not yet dry.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"6bc8"}},
{"insert":"　　He contemplated that gigantic sear which stamped heroism on that countenance upon which God had imprinted goodness.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"2eec"}},
{"insert":"　　He reflected that this man was his father, and that this man was dead, and a chill ran over him.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　Anguish, poignant anguish, was in that chamber.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　The servant-woman was lamenting in a corner, the cure was praying, and his sobs were audible, the doctor was wiping his eyes; the corpse itself was weeping.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"06c0"}},
{"insert":"　　The doctor, the priest, and the woman gazed at Marius in the midst of their affliction without uttering a word; he was the stranger there.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3160"}},
{"insert":"　　Marius, who was far too little affected, felt ashamed and embarrassed at his own attitude; he held his hat in his hand; and he dropped it on the floor, in order to produce the impression that grief had deprived him of the strength to hold it.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"c667"}},
{"insert":"　　At the same time, he experienced remorse, and he despised himself for behaving in this manner.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"e701"}},
{"insert":"　　But was it his fault?","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"0bd6"}},
{"insert":"　　He did not love his father?","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"09fb"}},
{"insert":"　　Why should he!","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"f991"}},

{"insert":"　　The sale of big furniture barely paid the expenses of his burial.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　The servant found a scrap of paper, which she handed to Marius. It contained the following, in the colonel's handwriting:--","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　 Marius had preserved the religious habits of his childhood. One Sunday, when he went to hear mass at Saint-Sulpice, at that same chapel of the Virgin whither his aunt had led him when a small lad, he placed himself behind a pillar, being more absent-minded and thoughtful than usual on that occasion, and knelt down, without paying any special heed, upon a chair of Utrecht velvet, on the back of which was inscribed this name:","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

He asserted in his conscience, that all this had been good. What his dazzled state neglected in this, his first far too synthetic estimation, we do not think it necessary to point out here.

{"insert":"　　\"He is pretty deeply in love!\" thought Theodule.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"907a"}},
{"insert":"　　Marius directed his steps towards the church.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　\"He is sleeping out.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"16e3"}},
{"insert":"　　Lieutenant Theodule was absolutely put out of countenance by this unexpected encounter with a sepulchre; he experienced a singular and disagreeable sensation which he was incapable of analyzing, and which was composed of respect for the tomb, mingled with respect for the colonel.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"d17f"}},
{"insert":"　　He retreated, leaving Marius alone in the cemetery, and there was discipline in this retreat.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"19eb"}},
{"insert":"　　Death appeared to him with large epaulets, and he almost made the military salute to him. Not knowing what to write to his aunt, he decided not to write at all; and it is probable that nothing would have resulted from the discovery made by Theodule as to the love affairs of Marius, if, by one of those mysterious arrangements which are so frequent in chance, the scene at Vernon had not had an almost immediate counter-shock at Paris.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"b024"}},
{"insert":"　　Marius returned from Vernon on the third day, in the middle of the morning, descended at his grandfather's door, and, wearied by the two nights spent in the diligence, and feeling the need of repairing his loss of sleep by an hour at the swimming-school, he mounted rapidly to his chamber, took merely time enough to throw off his travelling-coat, and the black ribbon which he wore round his neck, and went off to the bath.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"c6b7"}},
{"insert":"　　M.Gillenormand, who had risen betimes like all old men in good health, had heard his entrance, and had made haste to climb, as quickly as his old legs permitted, the stairs to the upper story where Marius lived, in order to embrace him, and to question him while so doing, and to find out where he had been.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"91f6"}},
{"insert":"　　But the youth had taken less time to descend than the old man had to ascend, and when Father Gillenormand entered the attic, Marius was no longer there.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a4da"}},
{"insert":"　　Only, M. Gillenormand said in a low voice and as though speaking to himself:--","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　At the same moment a little oblong packet, enveloped in blue paper, fell from one of the pockets of the great-coat. Mademoiselle Gillenormand picked it up and unfolded the blue paper.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　A GROUP WHICH BARELY MISSED BECOMING HISTORIC ","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3bcb"}},
{"insert":"　　At that epoch, which was, to all appearances indifferent, a certain revolutionary quiver was vaguely current.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"e94e"}},
{"insert":"　　Breaths which had started forth from the depths of '89 and '93 were in the air.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"82a4"}},
{"insert":"　　Youth was on the point, may the reader pardon us the word, of moulting. People were undergoing a transformation, almost without being conscious of it, through the movement of the age.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"8cf1"}},
{"insert":"　　The needle which moves round the compass also moves in souls.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5792"}},
{"insert":"　　Each person was taking that step in advance which he was bound to take. The Royalists were becoming liberals, liberals were turning democrats. It was a flood tide complicated with a thousand ebb movements; the peculiarity of e is to create intermixtures; hence the combination of very singular ideas; people adored both Napoleon and liberty. We are making history here.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"656b"}},
{"insert":"　　These were the mirages of that period. Opinions traverse phases.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"94a3"}},
{"insert":"　　Voltairian royalism, a quaint variety, had a no less singular sequel, Bonapartist liberalism.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"2f56"}},
{"insert":"　　Other groups of minds were more serious.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"6d86"}},
{"insert":"　　In that direction, they sounded principles, they attached themselves to the right. They grew enthusiastic for the absolute, they caught glimpses of infinite realizations; the absolute, by its very rigidity, urges spirits towards the sky and causes them to float in illimitable space. There is nothing like dogma for bringing forth dreams.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"affd"}},
{"insert":"　　And there is nothing like dreams for engendering the future.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　Utopia to-day, flesh and blood to-morrow.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a706"}},
{"insert":"　　These advanced opinions had a double foundation.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　A beginning of mystery menaced \"the established order of things,\" which was suspicious and underhand.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"062c"}},
{"insert":"　　A sign which was revolutionary to the highest degree.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　The second thoughts of power meet the second thoughts of the populace in the mine.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"0715"}},
{"insert":"　　The incubation of insurrections gives the retort to the premeditation of coups d'etat.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"214a"}},
{"insert":"　　There did not, as yet, exist in France any of those vast underlying organizations, like the German tugendbund and Italian Carbonarism; but here and there there were dark underminings, which were in process of throwing off shoots.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"06a6"}},
{"insert":"　　The Cougourde was being outlined at Aix; there existed at Paris, among other affiliations of that nature, the society of the Friends of the A B C.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　What were these Friends of the A B C?","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5061"}},
{"insert":"　　A society which had for its object apparently the education of children, in reality the elevation of man.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4c8d"}},
{"insert":"　　They declared themselves the Friends of the A B C,--the Abaisse,-- the debased,--that is to say, the people.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"2879"}},
{"insert":"　　They wished to elevate the people.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"39b4"}},
{"insert":"　　It was a pun which we should do wrong to smile at. Puns are sometimes serious factors in politics; witness the Castratus ad castra, which made a general of the army of Narses; witness: Barbari et Barberini; witness:","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　Tu es Petrus et super hanc petram, etc., etc.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"9db9"}},
{"insert":"　　The Friends of the A B C were not numerous, it was a secret society in the state of embryo, we might almost say a coterie, if coteries ended in heroes.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a4c6"}},
{"insert":"　　They assembled in Paris in two localities, near the fish-market, in a wine-shop called Corinthe, of which more will be heard later on, and near the Pantheon in a little cafe in the Rue Saint-Michel called the Cafe Musain, now torn down; the first of these meeting-places was close to the workingman, the second to the students.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"7c77"}},
{"insert":"　　The assemblies of the Friends of the A B C were usually held in a back room of the Cafe Musain.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"cd61"}},
{"insert":"　　This hall, which was tolerably remote from the cafe, with which it was connected by an extremely long corridor, had two windows and an exit with a private stairway on the little Rue des Gres.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"600d"}},
{"insert":"　　There they smoked and drank, and gambled and laughed.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ae5b"}},
{"insert":"　　There they conversed in very loud tones about everything, and in whispers of other things. An old map of France under the Republic was nailed to the wall,-- a sign quite sufficient to excite the suspicion of a police agent.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"b33c"}},
{"insert":"　　The greater part of the Friends of the A B C were students, who were on cordial terms with the working classes.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3c44"}},
{"insert":"　　Here are the names of the principal ones.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ba68"}},
{"insert":"　　They belong, in a certain measure, to history:","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"fead"}},
{"insert":"　　Enjolras, Combeferre, Jean Prouvaire, Feuilly, Courfeyrac, Bahorel, Lesgle or Laigle, Joly, Grantaire.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"8bd2"}},
{"insert":"　　These young men formed a sort of family, through the bond of friendship.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"356a"}},
{"insert":"　　All, with the exception of Laigle, were from the South.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"bf49"}},
{"insert":"　　This was a remarkable group.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4210"}},
{"insert":"　　It vanished in the invisible depths which lie behind us.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"255c"}},
{"insert":"　　At the point of this drama which we have now reached, it will not perhaps be superfluous to throw a ray of light upon these youthful heads, before the reader beholds them plunging into the shadow of a tragic adventure.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"7926"}},
{"insert":"　　Enjolras, whose name we have mentioned first of all,--the reader shall see why later on,--was an only son and wealthy.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"2f6e"}},
{"insert":"　　Enjolras was a charming young man, who was capable of being terrible. He was angelically handsome.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"915e"}},
{"insert":"　　He was a savage Antinous.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"12ee"}},
{"insert":"　　One would have said, to see the pensive thoughtfulness of his glance, that he had already, in some previous state of existence, traversed the revolutionary apocalypse.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"8bbd"}},
{"insert":"　　He possessed the tradition of it as though he had been a witness.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"bfff"}},
{"insert":"　　He was acquainted with all the minute details of the great affair.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"b88d"}},
{"insert":"　　A pontifical and warlike nature, a singular thing in a youth.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"f9d7"}},
{"insert":"　　He was an officiating priest and a man of war; from the immediate point of view, a soldier of the democracy; above the contemporary movement, the priest of the ideal.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"babc"}},
{"insert":"　　His eyes were deep, his lids a little red, his lower lip was thick and easily became disdainful, his brow was lofty.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"28ff"}},
{"insert":"　　A great deal of brow in a face is like a great deal of horizon in a view.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"dd2b"}},
{"insert":"　　Like certain young men at the beginning of this century and the end of the last, who became illustrious at an early age, he was endowed with excessive youth, and was as rosy as a young girl, although subject to hours of pallor. Already a man, he still seemed a child.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"191c"}},
{"insert":"　　His two and twenty years appeared to be but seventeen; he was serious, it did not seem as though he were aware there was on earth a thing called woman. He had but one passion--the right; but one thought--to overthrow the obstacle.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4214"}},
{"insert":"　　On Mount Aventine, he would have been Gracchus; in the Convention, he would have been Saint-Just. He hardly saw the roses, he ignored spring, he did not hear the carolling of the birds; the bare throat of Evadne would have moved him no more than it would have moved Aristogeiton; he, like Harmodius, thought flowers good for nothing except to conceal the sword. He was severe in his enjoyments.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"9bca"}},
{"insert":"　　He chastely dropped his eyes before everything which was not the Republic.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"401d"}},
{"insert":"　　He was the marble lover of liberty.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"9a5d"}},
{"insert":"　　His speech was harshly inspired, and had the thrill of a hymn.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"6f0f"}},
{"insert":"　　He was subject to unexpected outbursts of soul. Woe to the love-affair which should have risked itself beside him! If any grisette of the Place Cambrai or the Rue Saint-Jean-de-Beauvais, seeing that face of a youth escaped from college, that page's mien, those long, golden lashes, those blue eyes, that hair billowing in the wind, those rosy cheeks, those fresh lips, those exquisite teeth, had conceived an appetite for that complete aurora, and had tried her beauty on Enjolras, an astounding and terrible glance would have promptly shown her the abyss, and would have taught her not to confound the mighty cherub of Ezekiel with the gallant Cherubino of Beaumarchais.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"abc5"}},
{"insert":"　　By the side of Enjolras, who represented the logic of the Revolution, Combeferre represented its philosophy.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"aea6"}},
{"insert":"　　Between the logic of the Revolution and its philosophy there exists this difference--that its logic may end in war, whereas its philosophy can end only in peace. Combeferre complemented and rectified Enjolras.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"b8ba"}},
{"insert":"　　He was less lofty, but broader.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"0f02"}},
{"insert":"　　He desired to pour into all minds the extensive principles of general ideas:","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"fc3b"}},
{"insert":"　　he said:","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"92e7"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Revolution, but civilization\"; and around the mountain peak he opened out a vast view of the blue sky. The Revolution was more adapted for breathing with Combeferre than with Enjolras.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4f85"}},
{"insert":"　　Enjolras expressed its divine right, and Combeferre its natural right.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ce92"}},
{"insert":"　　The first attached himself to Robespierre; the second confined himself to Condorcet.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"b310"}},
{"insert":"　　Combeferre lived the life of all the rest of the world more than did Enjolras. If it had been granted to these two young men to attain to history, the one would have been the just, the other the wise man. Enjolras was the more virile, Combeferre the more humane.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"e836"}},
{"insert":"　　Homo and vir, that was the exact effect of their different shades.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"59ab"}},
{"insert":"　　Combeferre was as gentle as Enjolras was severe, through natural whiteness. He loved the word citizen, but he preferred the word man.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"bf5a"}},
{"insert":"　　He would gladly have said:","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3c00"}},
{"insert":"　　Hombre, like the Spanish.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"bacf"}},
{"insert":"　　He read everything, went to the theatres, attended the courses of public lecturers, learned the polarization of light from Arago, grew enthusiastic over a lesson in which Geoffrey Sainte-Hilaire explained the double function of the external carotid artery, and the internal, the one which makes the face, and the one which makes the brain; he kept up with what was going on, followed science step by step, compared Saint-Simon with Fourier, deciphered hieroglyphics, broke the pebble which he found and reasoned on geology, drew from memory a silkworm moth, pointed out the faulty French in the Dictionary of the Academy, studied Puysegur and Deleuze, affirmed nothing, not even miracles; denied nothing, not even ghosts; turned over the files of the Moniteur, reflected.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"da22"}},
{"insert":"　　He declared that the future lies in the hand of the schoolmaster, and busied himself with educational questions.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ee8d"}},
{"insert":"　　He desired that society should labor without relaxation at the elevation of the moral and intellectual level, at coining science, at putting ideas into circulation, at increasing the mind in youthful persons, and he feared lest the present poverty of method, the paltriness from a literary point of view confined to two or three centuries called classic, the tyrannical dogmatism of official pedants, scholastic prejudices and routines should end by converting our colleges into artificial oyster beds.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"eb56"}},
{"insert":"　　He was learned, a purist, exact, a graduate of the Polytechnic, a close student, and at the same time, thoughtful \"even to chimaeras,\" so his friends said. He believed in all dreams, railroads, the suppression of suffering in chirurgical operations, the fixing of images in the dark chamber, the electric telegraph, the steering of balloons.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"9c37"}},
{"insert":"　　Moreover, he was not much alarmed by the citadels erected against the human mind in every direction, by superstition, despotism, and prejudice. He was one of those who think that science will eventually turn the position.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　Enjolras.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5db5"}},
{"insert":"　　 On a certain afternoon, which had, as will be seen hereafter, some coincidence with the events heretofore related, Laigle de Meaux was to be seen leaning in a sensual manner against the doorpost of the Cafe Musain.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"c92b"}},
{"insert":"　　He had the air of a caryatid on a vacation; he carried nothing but his revery, however.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"765a"}},
{"insert":"　　He was staring at the Place Saint-Michel. To lean one's back against a thing is equivalent to lying down while standing erect, which attitude is not hated by thinkers.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4383"}},
{"insert":"　　Laigle de Meaux was pondering without melancholy, over a little misadventure which had befallen him two days previously at the law-school, and which had modified his personal plans for the future, plans which were rather indistinct in any case.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a139"}},
{"insert":"　　Revery does not prevent a cab from passing by, nor the dreamer from taking note of that cab.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"14d9"}},
{"insert":"　　Laigle de Meaux, whose eyes were straying about in a sort of diffuse lounging, perceived, athwart his somnambulism, a two-wheeled vehicle proceeding through the place, at a foot pace and apparently in indecision. For whom was this cabriolet?","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"331e"}},
{"insert":"　　Why was it driving at a walk? Laigle took a survey.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"2366"}},
{"insert":"　　In it, beside the coachman, sat a young man, and in front of the young man lay a rather bulky hand-bag. The bag displayed to passers-by the following name inscribed in large black letters on a card which was sewn to the stuff:","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"20d4"}},
{"insert":"　　MARIUS PONTMERCY.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4758"}},
{"insert":"　　This name caused Laigle to change his attitude.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"df58"}},
{"insert":"　　He drew himself up and hurled this apostrophe at the young man in the cabriolet:--","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ba4e"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Monsieur Marius Pontmercy!\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"93c7"}},
{"insert":"　　The cabriolet thus addressed came to a halt.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"8e6f"}},
{"insert":"　　The young man, who also seemed deeply buried in thought, raised his eyes:--","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"40f7"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Hey?\" said he.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3445"}},

{"insert":"　　\"I was looking for you,\" resumed Laigle de Meaux.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"1136"}},
{"insert":"　　\"How so?\" demanded Marius; for it was he:","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"e6a1"}},
{"insert":"　　in fact, he had just quitted his grandfather's, and had before him a face which he now beheld for the first time.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　\"I do not know you.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　The call was not going badly. No erasures; the universe was present.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"66de"}},
{"insert":"　　Blondeau was grieved. I said to myself:","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5e95"}},
{"insert":"　　`Blondeau, my love, you will not get the very smallest sort of an execution to-day.' All at once Blondeau calls, `Marius Pontmercy!'","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"e38a"}},
{"insert":"　　No one answers.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a7f7"}},
{"insert":"　　Blondeau, filled with hope, repeats more loudly:","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"0a58"}},
{"insert":"　　`Marius Pontmercy!'","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"08c9"}},
{"insert":"　　And he takes his pen. Monsieur, I have bowels of compassion.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"d4d5"}},
{"insert":"　　I said to myself hastily: `Here's a brave fellow who is going to get scratched out.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　Attention. Here is a veritable mortal who is not exact.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3e07"}},
{"insert":"　　He's not a good student. Here is none of your heavy-sides, a student who studies, a greenhorn pedant, strong on letters, theology, science, and sapience, one of those dull wits cut by the square; a pin by profession. He is an honorable idler who lounges, who practises country jaunts, who cultivates the grisette, who pays court to the fair sex, who is at this very moment, perhaps, with my mistress.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"7791"}},
{"insert":"　　Let us save him.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"05f4"}},
{"insert":"　　Death to Blondeau!'","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"475f"}},
{"insert":"　　At that moment, Blondeau dipped his pen in, all black with erasures in the ink, cast his yellow eyes round the audience room, and repeated for the third time: `Marius Pontmercy!'","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a355"}},
{"insert":"　　I replied:","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　`Present!' This is why you were not crossed off.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"470e"}},
{"insert":"　　\"I do not understand you,\" said Marius.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　\"Nothing is more simple.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3e3d"}},
{"insert":"　　I was close to the desk to reply, and close to the door for the purpose of flight.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"d9fc"}},
{"insert":"　　The professor gazed at me with a certain intensity.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"52ae"}},
{"insert":"　　All of a sudden, Blondeau, who must be the malicious nose alluded to by Boileau, skipped to the letter L. L is my letter.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　`lf you are Pontmercy, you are not Laigle.'","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　A terrible thing it is, containing days without bread, nights without sleep, evenings without a candle, a hearth without a fire, weeks without work, a future without hope, a coat out at the elbows, an old hat which evokes the laughter of young girls, a door which one finds locked on one at night because one's rent is not paid, the insolence of the porter and the cook-shop man, the sneers of neighbors, humiliations, dignity trampled on, work of whatever nature accepted, disgusts, bitterness, despondency.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　At that moment of his existence when a man needs his pride, because he needs love, he felt that he was jeered at because he was badly dressed, and ridiculous because he was poor. At the age when youth swells the heart with imperial pride, he dropped his eyes more than once on his dilapidated boots, and he knew the unjust shame and the poignant blushes of wretchedness.

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ec13"}},
{"insert":"　　He had endured everything in the way of destitution; he had done everything except contract debts. He did himself the justice to say that he had never owed any one a sou. A debt was, to him, the beginning of slavery.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a6e0"}},
{"insert":"　　He even said to himself, that a creditor is worse than a master; for the master possesses only your person, a creditor possesses your dignity and can administer to it a box on the ear.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"56a8"}},
{"insert":"　　Feeling that all extremes meet, and that, if one is not on one's guard, lowered fortunes may lead to baseness of soul, he kept a jealous watch on his pride.

{"insert":"　　Marius, with his grave and enthusiastic nature, surrounded with a sort of aureole the man to whom, in his thoughts, he owed his father's life,--that intrepid sergeant who had saved the colonel amid the bullets and the cannon-balls of Waterloo.

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3f5b"}},
{"insert":"　　What redoubled the tenderness of his gratitude towards Thenardier, was the idea of the distress into which he knew that Thenardier had fallen, and which had engulfed the latter.

{"insert":"　　MARIUS GROWN UP","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"62ad"}},
{"insert":"　　 At this epoch, Marius was twenty years of age.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"0f5a"}},
{"insert":"　　It was three years since he had left his grandfather.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"d008"}},
{"insert":"　　Both parties had remained on the same terms, without attempting to approach each other, and without seeking to see each other.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"fa82"}},
{"insert":"　　Besides, what was the use of seeing each other?","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"9032"}},
{"insert":"　　Marius was the brass vase, while Father Gillenormand was the iron pot.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"d456"}},
{"insert":"　　We admit that Marius was mistaken as to his grandfather's heart. He had imagined that M. Gillenormand had never loved him, and that that crusty, harsh, and smiling old fellow who cursed, shouted, and stormed and brandished his cane, cherished for him, at the most, only that affection, which is at once slight and severe, of the dotards of comedy.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"f0f6"}},
{"insert":"　　Marius was in error. There are fathers who do not love their children; there exists no grandfather who does not adore his grandson.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"b92d"}},
{"insert":"　　At bottom, as we have said, M. Gillenormand idolized Marius.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"343c"}},
{"insert":"　　He idolized him after his own fashion, with an accompaniment of snappishness and boxes on the ear; but, this child once gone, he felt a black void in his heart; he would allow no one to mention the child to him, and all the while secretly regretted that he was so well obeyed. At first, he hoped that this Buonapartist, this Jacobin, this terrorist, this Septembrist, would return.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"d02b"}},
{"insert":"　　But the weeks passed by, years passed; to M. Gillenormand's great despair, the \"blood-drinker\" did not make his appearance.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"27bf"}},
{"insert":"　　\"I could not do otherwise than turn him out,\" said the grandfather to himself, and he asked himself: \"If the thing were to do over again, would I do it?\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"90a8"}},
{"insert":"　　His pride instantly answered \"yes,\" but his aged head, which he shook in silence, replied sadly \"no.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5ec5"}},
{"insert":"　　He had his hours of depression. He missed Marius.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　Strong as his nature was, the absence of Marius had wrought some change in him.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"d8d5"}},
{"insert":"　　Nothing in the world could have induced him to take a step towards \"that rogue\"; but he suffered. He never inquired about him, but he thought of him incessantly. He lived in the Marais in a more and more retired manner; he was still merry and violent as of old, but his merriment had a convulsive harshness, and his violences always terminated in a sort of gentle and gloomy dejection.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"0457"}},
{"insert":"　　He sometimes said: \"Oh! if he only would return, what a good box on the ear I would give him!\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"7f79"}},
{"insert":"　　As for his aunt, she thought too little to love much; Marius was no longer for her much more than a vague black form; and she eventually came to occupy herself with him much less than with the cat or the paroquet which she probably had.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"c3b5"}},
{"insert":"　　What augmented Father Gillenormand's secret suffering was, that he locked it all up within his breast, and did not allow its existence to be divined. His sorrow was like those recently invented furnaces which consume their own smoke.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5bef"}},
{"insert":"　　It sometimes happened that officious busybodies spoke to him of Marius, and asked him:","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"2378"}},
{"insert":"　　\"What is your grandson doing?\" \"What has become of him?\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"92ee"}},
{"insert":"　　The old bourgeois replied with a sigh, that he was a sad case, and giving a fillip to his cuff, if he wished to appear gay:","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　\"Monsieur le Baron de Pontmercy is practising pettifogging in some corner or other.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　While the old man regretted, Marius applauded himself. As is the case with all good-hearted people, misfortune had eradicated his bitterness.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"f9c5"}},
{"insert":"　　He only thought of M. Gillenormand in an amiable light, but he had set his mind on not receiving anything more from the man who had been unkind to his father. This was the mitigated translation of his first indignation. Moreover, he was happy at having suffered, and at suffering still. It was for his father's sake.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3f27"}},
{"insert":"　　The hardness of his life satisfied and pleased him.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"313b"}},
{"insert":"　　He said to himself with a sort of joy that-- it was certainly the least he could do; that it was an expiation;-- that, had it not been for that, he would have been punished in some other way and later on for his impious indifference towards his father, and such a father! that it would not have been just that his father should have all the suffering, and he none of it; and that, in any case, what were his toils and his destitution compared with the colonel's heroic life? that, in short, the only way for him to approach his father and resemble him, was to be brave in the face of indigence, as the other had been valiant before the enemy; and that that was, no doubt, what the colonel had meant to imply by the words: \"He will be worthy of it.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"6f13"}},
{"insert":"　　Words which Marius continued to wear, not on his breast, since the colonel's writing had disappeared, but in his heart.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5d21"}},
{"insert":"　　And then, on the day when his grandfather had turned him out of doors, he had been only a child, now he was a man.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"c68b"}},
{"insert":"　　He felt it.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"393f"}},
{"insert":"　　Misery, we repeat, had been good for him.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"c510"}},
{"insert":"　　Poverty in youth, when it succeeds, has this magnificent property about it, that it turns the whole will towards effort, and the whole soul towards aspiration. Poverty instantly lays material life bare and renders it hideous; hence inexpressible bounds towards the ideal life.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"1489"}},
{"insert":"　　The wealthy young man has a hundred coarse and brilliant distractions, horse races, hunting, dogs, tobacco, gaming, good repasts, and all the rest of it; occupations for the baser side of the soul, at the expense of the loftier and more delicate sides.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4021"}},
{"insert":"　　The poor young man wins his bread with difficulty; he eats; when he has eaten, he has nothing more but meditation.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3b06"}},
{"insert":"　　He goes to the spectacles which God furnishes gratis; he gazes at the sky, space, the stars, flowers, children, the humanity among which he is suffering, the creation amid which he beams. He gazes so much on humanity that he perceives its soul, he gazes upon creation to such an extent that he beholds God.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3838"}},
{"insert":"　　He dreams, he feels himself great; he dreams on, and feels himself tender. From the egotism of the man who suffers he passes to the compassion of the man who meditates.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"76ea"}},
{"insert":"　　An admirable sentiment breaks forth in him, forgetfulness of self and pity for all. As he thinks of the innumerable enjoyments which nature offers, gives, and lavishes to souls which stand open, and refuses to souls that are closed, he comes to pity, he the millionnaire of the mind, the millionnaire of money.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　All hatred departs from his heart, in proportion as light penetrates his spirit.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　The first young lad who comes to hand, however poor he may be, with his strength, his health, his rapid walk, his brilliant eyes, his warmly circulating blood, his black hair, his red lips, his white teeth, his pure breath, will always arouse the envy of an aged emperor. And then, every morning, he sets himself afresh to the task of earning his bread; and while his hands earn his bread, his dorsal column gains pride, his brain gathers ideas.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"157a"}},
{"insert":"　　His task finished, he returns to ineffable ecstasies, to contemplation, to joys; he beholds his feet set in afflictions, in obstacles, on the pavement, in the nettles, sometimes in the mire; his head in the light.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4197"}},
{"insert":"　　He is firm serene, gentle, peaceful, attentive, serious, content with little, kindly; and he thanks God for having bestowed on him those two forms of riches which many a rich man lacks:","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"03a4"}},
{"insert":"　　work, which makes him free; and thought, which makes him dignified.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"c021"}},
{"insert":"　　This is what had happened with Marius.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"868a"}},
{"insert":"　　To tell the truth, he inclined a little too much to the side of contemplation.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"20a1"}},
{"insert":"　　From the day when he had succeeded in earning his living with some approach to certainty, he had stopped, thinking it good to be poor, and retrenching time from his work to give to thought; that is to say, he sometimes passed entire days in meditation, absorbed, engulfed, like a visionary, in the mute voluptuousness of ecstasy and inward radiance. He had thus propounded the problem of his life:","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"016c"}},
{"insert":"　　to toil as little as possible at material labor, in order to toil as much as possible at the labor which is impalpable; in other words, to bestow a few hours on real life, and to cast the rest to the infinite.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"6176"}},
{"insert":"　　As he believed that he lacked nothing, he did not perceive that contemplation, thus understood, ends by becoming one of the forms of idleness; that he was contenting himself with conquering the first necessities of life, and that he was resting from his labors too soon.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"97e9"}},
{"insert":"　　It was evident that, for this energetic and enthusiastic nature, this could only be a transitory state, and that, at the first shock against the inevitable complications of destiny, Marius would awaken.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ee5d"}},
{"insert":"　　In the meantime, although he was a lawyer, and whatever Father Gillenormand thought about the matter, he was not practising, he was not even pettifogging.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"53ca"}},
{"insert":"　　Meditation had turned him aside from pleading. To haunt attorneys, to follow the court, to hunt up cases-- what a bore!","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"c2b3"}},
{"insert":"　　One of the publishers for whom he worked, M. Magimel, I think, offered to take him into his own house, to lodge him well, to furnish him with regular occupation, and to give him fifteen hundred francs a year.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　According to Marius' opinion, if he accepted, his position would become both better and worse at the same time, he acquired comfort, and lost his dignity; it was a fine and complete unhappiness converted into a repulsive and ridiculous state of torture: something like the case of a blind man who should recover the sight of one eye.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　\"Certainly I approve of political opinions,\" he expressed the real state of his mind.

{"insert":"　　M. Mabeuf's political opinion consisted in a passionate love for plants, and, above all, for books. Like all the rest of the world, he possessed the termination in ist, without which no one could exist at that time, but he was neither a Royalist, a Bonapartist, a Chartist, an Orleanist, nor an Anarchist; he was a bouquinist, a collector of old books.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　He did not understand how men could busy themselves with hating each other because of silly stuff like the charter, democracy, legitimacy, monarchy, the republic, etc., when there were in the world all sorts of mosses, grasses, and shrubs which they might be looking at, and heaps of folios, and even of 32mos, which they might turn over.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"cc4d"}},
{"insert":"　　He went to mass rather from gentleness than from piety, and because, as he loved the faces of men, but hated their noise, he found them assembled and silent only in church.

{"insert":"　　When Marius was saturated with military glory, with gunpowder, with marches and countermarches, and with all those prodigious battles in which his father had given and received such tremendous blows of the sword, he went to see M.

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"e5c7"}},
{"insert":"　　His brother the cure died about 1830, and almost immediately, as when the night is drawing on, the whole horizon grew dark for M. Mabeuf. A notary's failure deprived him of the sum of ten thousand francs, which was all that he possessed in his brother's right and his own. The Revolution of July brought a crisis to publishing.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　\"Monsieur,\" said Mother Plutarque sadly, \"it is the water-carrier.\" In short, one day, M. Mabeuf quitted the Rue Mesieres, abdicated the functions of warden, gave up Saint-Sulpice, sold not a part of his books, but of his prints,-- that to which he was the least attached,--and installed himself in a little house on the Rue Montparnasse, where, however, he remained but one quarter for two reasons:","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a66f"}},
{"insert":"　　in the first place, the ground floor and the garden cost three hundred francs, and he dared not spend more than two hundred francs on his rent; in the second, being near Faton's shooting-gallery, he could hear the pistol-shots; which was intolerable to him.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4215"}},
{"insert":"　　He carried off his Flora, his copper-plates, his herbariums, his portfolios, and his books, and established himself near the Salpetriere, in a sort of thatched cottage of the village of Austerlitz, where, for fifty crowns a year, he got three rooms and a garden enclosed by a hedge, and containing a well.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ef4c"}},
{"insert":"　　He took advantage of this removal to sell off nearly all his furniture. On the day of his entrance into his new quarters, he was very gay, and drove the nails on which his engravings and herbariums were to hang, with his own hands, dug in his garden the rest of the day, and at night, perceiving that Mother Plutarque had a melancholy air, and was very thoughtful, he tapped her on the shoulder and said to her with a smile:","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"7906"}},
{"insert":"　　Only two visitors, the bookseller of the Porte-Saint-Jacques and Marius, were admitted to view the thatched cottage at Austerlitz, a brawling name which was, to tell the truth, extremely disagreeable to him.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"16a9"}},
{"insert":"　　However, as we have just pointed out, brains which are absorbed in some bit of wisdom, or folly, or, as it often happens, in both at once, are but slowly accessible to the things of actual life. Their own destiny is a far-off thing to them.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　There results from such concentration a passivity, which, if it were the outcome of reasoning, would resemble philosophy.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"cd3d"}},
{"insert":"　　One declines, descends, trickles away, even crumbles away, and yet is hardly conscious of it one's self. It always ends, it is true, in an awakening, but the awakening is tardy. In the meantime, it seems as though we held ourselves neutral in the game which is going on between our happiness and our unhappiness. We are the stake, and we look on at the game with indifference.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3024"}},
{"insert":"　　It is thus that, athwart the cloud which formed about him, when all his hopes were extinguished one after the other, M. Mabeuf remained rather puerilely, but profoundly serene.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a8c5"}},
{"insert":"　　His habits of mind had the regular swing of a pendulum.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"49e1"}},
{"insert":"　　One day, Mother Plutarque was reading a romance in one corner of the room. She was reading aloud, finding that she understood better thus.

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"b7cb"}},
{"insert":"　　He often spent half a day in gazing at a market garden, the beds of lettuce, the chickens on the dung-heap, the horse turning the water-wheel.

{"insert":"　　It was during one of his strolls that he had hit upon the Gorbeau house, and, tempted by its isolation and its cheapness, had taken up his abode there.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"7b0b"}},
{"insert":"　　He was known there only under the name of M. Marius.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

They are deformed, and they complete themselves by being stupid; they repeat the puns of Tiercelin and Potier, they have sack coats, stablemen's waistcoats, shirts of coarse linen, trousers of coarse cloth, boots of coarse leather, and their rigmarole resembles their plumage.

{"insert":"　　If he had worn a decoration, Marius would have said: \"He is an ex-officer.\" He had a kindly but unapproachable air, and he never let his glance linger on the eyes of any one.

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4772"}},
{"insert":"　　 During the second year, precisely at the point in this history which the reader has now reached, it chanced that this habit of the Luxembourg was interrupted, without Marius himself being quite aware why, and nearly six months elapsed, during which he did not set foot in the alley.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"1c5e"}},
{"insert":"　　One day, at last, he returned thither once more; it was a serene summer morning, and Marius was in joyous mood, as one is when the weather is fine.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"31b9"}},
{"insert":"　　It seemed to him that he had in his heart all the songs of the birds that he was listening to, and all the bits of blue sky of which he caught glimpses through the leaves of the trees.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4501"}},
{"insert":"　　He went straight to \"his alley,\" and when he reached the end of it he perceived, still on the same bench, that well-known couple. Only, when he approached, it certainly was the same man; but it seemed to him that it was no longer the same girl.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"0cf5"}},
{"insert":"　　The person whom he now beheld was a tall and beautiful creature, possessed of all the most charming lines of a woman at the precise moment when they are still combined with all the most ingenuous graces of the child; a pure and fugitive moment, which can be expressed only by these two words,-- \"fifteen years.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"39ae"}},
{"insert":"　　She had wonderful brown hair, shaded with threads of gold, a brow that seemed made of marble, cheeks that seemed made of rose-leaf, a pale flush, an agitated whiteness, an exquisite mouth, whence smiles darted like sunbeams, and words like music, a head such as Raphael would have given to Mary, set upon a neck that Jean Goujon would have attributed to a Venus.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"aea5"}},
{"insert":"　　And, in order that nothing might be lacking to this bewitching face, her nose was not handsome-- it was pretty; neither straight nor curved, neither Italian nor Greek; it was the Parisian nose, that is to say, spiritual, delicate, irregular, pure,--which drives painters to despair, and charms poets.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5185"}},
{"insert":"　　When Marius passed near her, he could not see her eyes, which were constantly lowered.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4414"}},
{"insert":"　　He saw only her long chestnut lashes, permeated with shadow and modesty.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"143d"}},
{"insert":"　　This did not prevent the beautiful child from smiling as she listened to what the white-haired old man was saying to her, and nothing could be more fascinating than that fresh smile, combined with those drooping eyes.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"766a"}},
{"insert":"　　For a moment, Marius thought that she was another daughter of the same man, a sister of the former, no doubt.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5871"}},
{"insert":"　　But when the invariable habit of his stroll brought him, for the second time, near the bench, and he had examined her attentively, he recognized her as the same. In six months the little girl had become a young maiden; that was all. Nothing is more frequent than this phenomenon.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"7596"}},
{"insert":"　　There is a moment when girls blossom out in the twinkling of an eye, and become roses all at once.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　Her April had arrived.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"fa80"}},
{"insert":"　　One sometimes sees people, who, poor and mean, seem to wake up, pass suddenly from indigence to luxury, indulge in expenditures of all sorts, and become dazzling, prodigal, magnificent, all of a sudden.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"7503"}},
{"insert":"　　That is the result of having pocketed an income; a note fell due yesterday.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　The young girl had received her quarterly income.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"55b2"}},
{"insert":"　　And then, she was no longer the school-girl with her felt hat, her merino gown, her scholar's shoes, and red hands; taste had come to her with beauty; she was a well-dressed person, clad with a sort of rich and simple elegance, and without affectation. She wore a dress of black damask, a cape of the same material, and a bonnet of white crape.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"71cf"}},
{"insert":"　　Her white gloves displayed the delicacy of the hand which toyed with the carved, Chinese ivory handle of a parasol, and her silken shoe outlined the smallness of her foot. When one passed near her, her whole toilette exhaled a youthful and penetrating perfume.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　As for the man, he was the same as usual.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"6ca4"}},
{"insert":"　　The second time that Marius approached her, the young girl raised her eyelids; her eyes were of a deep, celestial blue, but in that veiled azure, there was, as yet, nothing but the glance of a child. She looked at Marius indifferently, as she would have stared at the brat running beneath the sycamores, or the marble vase which cast a shadow on the bench, and Marius, on his side, continued his promenade, and thought about something else.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"33c5"}},

{"insert":"　　 One day, the air was warm, the Luxembourg was inundated with light and shade, the sky was as pure as though the angels had washed it that morning, the sparrows were giving vent to little twitters in the depths of the chestnut-trees. Marius had thrown open his whole soul to nature, he was not thinking of anything, he simply lived and breathed, he passed near the bench, the young girl raised her eyes to him, the two glances met.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　There was nothing and there was everything. It was a strange flash.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　There comes a day when the young girl glances in this manner. Woe to him who chances to be there!","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"6591"}},
{"insert":"　　That first gaze of a soul which does not, as yet, know itself, is like the dawn in the sky.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"bf7e"}},
{"insert":"　　It is the awakening of something radiant and strange.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"1381"}},
{"insert":"　　Nothing can give any idea of the dangerous charm of that unexpected gleam, which flashes suddenly and vaguely forth from adorable shadows, and which is composed of all the innocence of the present, and of all the passion of the future. It is a sort of undecided tenderness which reveals itself by chance, and which waits.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"c710"}},
{"insert":"　　It is a snare which the innocent maiden sets unknown to herself, and in which she captures hearts without either wishing or knowing it.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ba1d"}},
{"insert":"　　It is a virgin looking like a woman.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3ca7"}},
{"insert":"　　It is rare that a profound revery does not spring from that glance, where it falls.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"6e40"}},
{"insert":"　　All purities and all candors meet in that celestial and fatal gleam which, more than all the best-planned tender glances of coquettes, possesses the magic power of causing the sudden blossoming, in the depths of the soul, of that sombre flower, impregnated with perfume and with poison, which is called love.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5711"}},
{"insert":"　　That evening, on his return to his garret, Marius cast his eyes over his garments, and perceived, for the first time, that he had been so slovenly, indecorous, and inconceivably stupid as to go for his walk in the Luxembourg with his \"every-day clothes,\" that is to say, with a hat battered near the band, coarse carter's boots, black trousers which showed white at the knees, and a black coat which was pale at the elbows.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　BEGINNING OF A GREAT MALADY","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ca68"}},
{"insert":"　　 On the following day, at the accustomed hour, Marius drew from his wardrobe his new coat, his new trousers, his new hat, and his new boots; he clothed himself in this complete panoply, put on his gloves, a tremendous luxury, and set off for the Luxembourg.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"477c"}},
{"insert":"　　On the way thither, he encountered Courfeyrac, and pretended not to see him.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a458"}},
{"insert":"　　Courfeyrac, on his return home, said to his friends:--","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4af4"}},
{"insert":"　　\"I have just met Marius' new hat and new coat, with Marius inside them.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"b2d8"}},
{"insert":"　　He was going to pass an examination, no doubt. He looked utterly stupid.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"f26c"}},
{"insert":"　　On arriving at the Luxembourg, Marius made the tour of the fountain basin, and stared at the swans; then he remained for a long time in contemplation before a statue whose head was perfectly black with mould, and one of whose hips was missing.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"9a35"}},
{"insert":"　　Near the basin there was a bourgeois forty years of age, with a prominent stomach, who was holding by the hand a little urchin of five, and saying to him:","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"0307"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Shun excess, my son, keep at an equal distance from despotism and from anarchy.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"194c"}},
{"insert":"　　Marius listened to this bourgeois. Then he made the circuit of the basin once more.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"def3"}},
{"insert":"　　At last he directed his course towards \"his alley,\" slowly, and as if with regret. One would have said that he was both forced to go there and withheld from doing so.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"70dd"}},
{"insert":"　　He did not perceive it himself, and thought that he was doing as he always did.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"cf8e"}},
{"insert":"　　On turning into the walk, he saw M. Leblanc and the young girl at the other end, \"on their bench.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"961f"}},
{"insert":"　　He buttoned his coat up to the very top, pulled it down on his body so that there might be no wrinkles, examined, with a certain complaisance, the lustrous gleams of his trousers, and marched on the bench.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"c39d"}},
{"insert":"　　This march savored of an attack, and certainly of a desire for conquest.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5f0e"}},
{"insert":"　　So I say that he marched on the bench, as I should say:","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"58da"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Hannibal marched on Rome.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"20fc"}},
{"insert":"　　However, all his movements were purely mechanical, and he had interrupted none of the habitual preoccupations of his mind and labors.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"069d"}},
{"insert":"　　At that moment, he was thinking that the Manuel du Baccalaureat was a stupid book, and that it must have been drawn up by rare idiots, to allow of three tragedies of Racine and only one comedy of Moliere being analyzed therein as masterpieces of the human mind.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"7985"}},
{"insert":"　　There was a piercing whistling going on in his ears. As he approached the bench, he held fast to the folds in his coat, and fixed his eyes on the young girl.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"7af7"}},
{"insert":"　　It seemed to him that she filled the entire extremity of the alley with a vague blue light.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"9cbb"}},
{"insert":"　　In proportion as he drew near, his pace slackened more and more. On arriving at some little distance from the bench, and long before he had reached the end of the walk, he halted, and could not explain to himself why he retraced his steps.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"20c6"}},
{"insert":"　　He did not even say to himself that he would not go as far as the end.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"263e"}},
{"insert":"　　It was only with difficulty that the young girl could have perceived him in the distance and noted his fine appearance in his new clothes.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"e451"}},
{"insert":"　　Nevertheless, he held himself very erect, in case any one should be looking at him from behind.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"57fe"}},
{"insert":"　　He attained the opposite end, then came back, and this time he approached a little nearer to the bench.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"0595"}},
{"insert":"　　He even got to within three intervals of trees, but there he felt an indescribable impossibility of proceeding further, and he hesitated.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"16b5"}},
{"insert":"　　He thought he saw the young girl's face bending towards him.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"230b"}},
{"insert":"　　But he exerted a manly and violent effort, subdued his hesitation, and walked straight ahead.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"8bc8"}},
{"insert":"　　A few seconds later, he rushed in front of the bench, erect and firm, reddening to the very ears, without daring to cast a glance either to the right or to the left, with his hand thrust into his coat like a statesman.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"bcfc"}},
{"insert":"　　At the moment when he passed,-- under the cannon of the place,--he felt his heart beat wildly. As on the preceding day, she wore her damask gown and her crape bonnet. He heard an ineffable voice, which must have been \"her voice.\" She was talking tranquilly.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ac7a"}},
{"insert":"　　She was very pretty.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4822"}},
{"insert":"　　He felt it, although he made no attempt to see her.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"9f03"}},
{"insert":"　　\"She could not, however,\" he thought, \"help feeling esteem and consideration for me, if she only knew that I am the veritable author of the dissertation on Marcos Obregon de la Ronde, which M. Francois de Neufchateau put, as though it were his own, at the head of his edition of Gil Blas.\" He went beyond the bench as far as the extremity of the walk, which was very near, then turned on his heel and passed once more in front of the lovely girl.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"f321"}},
{"insert":"　　This time, he was very pale. Moreover, all his emotions were disagreeable.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"0eac"}},
{"insert":"　　As he went further from the bench and the young girl, and while his back was turned to her, he fancied that she was gazing after him, and that made him stumble.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"185f"}},
{"insert":"　　He did not attempt to approach the bench again; he halted near the middle of the walk, and there, a thing which he never did, he sat down, and reflecting in the most profoundly indistinct depths of his spirit, that after all, it was hard that persons whose white bonnet and black gown he admired should be absolutely insensible to his splendid trousers and his new coat.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"9b46"}},
{"insert":"　　At the expiration of a quarter of an hour, he rose, as though he were on the point of again beginning his march towards that bench which was surrounded by an aureole.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"6bab"}},
{"insert":"　　But he remained standing there, motionless.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5dff"}},
{"insert":"　　For the first time in fifteen months, he said to himself that that gentleman who sat there every day with his daughter, had, on his side, noticed him, and probably considered his assiduity singular.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"75cd"}},

{"insert":"　　TAKEN PRISONER","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"b71a"}},
{"insert":"　　 On one of the last days of the second week, Marius was seated on his bench, as usual, holding in his hand an open book, of which he had not turned a page for the last two hours.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"1e27"}},
{"insert":"　　All at once he started. An event was taking place at the other extremity of the walk. Leblanc and his daughter had just left their seat, and the daughter had taken her father's arm, and both were advancing slowly, towards the middle of the alley where Marius was.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"0122"}},
{"insert":"　　Marius closed his book, then opened it again, then forced himself to read; he trembled; the aureole was coming straight towards him.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4f9a"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Ah! good Heavens!\" thought he, \"I shall not have time to strike an attitude.\" Still the white-haired man and the girl advanced.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"7cb6"}},
{"insert":"　　It seemed to him that this lasted for a century, and that it was but a second. \"What are they coming in this direction for?\" he asked himself. \"What!","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5cac"}},
{"insert":"　　She will pass here?","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5bf4"}},
{"insert":"　　Her feet will tread this sand, this walk, two paces from me?\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"654c"}},
{"insert":"　　He was utterly upset, he would have liked to be very handsome, he would have liked to own the cross. He heard the soft and measured sound of their approaching footsteps. He imagined that M. Leblanc was darting angry glances at him. \"Is that gentleman going to address me?\" he thought to himself. He dropped his head; when he raised it again, they were very near him. The young girl passed, and as she passed, she glanced at him. She gazed steadily at him, with a pensive sweetness which thrilled Marius from head to foot.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a473"}},
{"insert":"　　It seemed to him that she was reproaching him for having allowed so long a time to elapse without coming as far as her, and that she was saying to him:","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"b2a3"}},
{"insert":"　　\"I am coming myself.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a4e9"}},
{"insert":"　　Marius was dazzled by those eyes fraught with rays and abysses.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"1fd7"}},
{"insert":"　　He felt his brain on fire.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5130"}},
{"insert":"　　She had come to him, what joy! And then, how she had looked at him!","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"527f"}},
{"insert":"　　She appeared to him more beautiful than he had ever seen her yet.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4d5b"}},
{"insert":"　　Beautiful with a beauty which was wholly feminine and angelic, with a complete beauty which would have made Petrarch sing and Dante kneel.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"80df"}},
{"insert":"　　It seemed to him that he was floating free in the azure heavens.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"0ed1"}},
{"insert":"　　At the same time, he was horribly vexed because there was dust on his boots.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"df0d"}},
{"insert":"　　He thought he felt sure that she had looked at his boots too.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"e4b6"}},
{"insert":"　　He followed her with his eyes until she disappeared.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"15de"}},
{"insert":"　　Then he started up and walked about the Luxembourg garden like a madman. It is possible that, at times, he laughed to himself and talked aloud. He was so dreamy when he came near the children's nurses, that each one of them thought him in love with her.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4409"}},
{"insert":"　　He quitted the Luxembourg, hoping to find her again in the street.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5bc8"}},
{"insert":"　　He encountered Courfeyrac under the arcades of the Odeon, and said to him:","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a019"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Come and dine with me.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3dfb"}},
{"insert":"　　They went off to Rousseau's and spent six francs.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"89ad"}},
{"insert":"　　Marius ate like an ogre.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"60d0"}},
{"insert":"　　He gave the waiter six sous. At dessert, he said to Courfeyrac.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5779"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Have you read the paper? What a fine discourse Audry de Puyraveau delivered!\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"182f"}},
{"insert":"　　He was desperately in love.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5c7b"}},
{"insert":"　　After dinner, he said to Courfeyrac:","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3e18"}},
{"insert":"　　\"I will treat you to the play.\" They went to the Porte-Sainte-Martin to see Frederick in l'Auberge des Adrets.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"b9f0"}},
{"insert":"　　Marius was enormously amused.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"6c52"}},
{"insert":"　　At the same time, he had a redoubled attack of shyness. On emerging from the theatre, he refused to look at the garter of a modiste who was stepping across a gutter, and Courfeyrac, who said:","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"94bf"}},
{"insert":"　　\"I should like to put that woman in my collection,\" almost horrified him.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"87de"}},
{"insert":"　　Courfeyrac invited him to breakfast at the Cafe Voltaire on the following morning.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"807e"}},
{"insert":"　　Marius went thither, and ate even more than on the preceding evening.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"1098"}},
{"insert":"　　He was very thoughtful and very merry. One would have said that he was taking advantage of every occasion to laugh uproariously.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"01a7"}},
{"insert":"　　He tenderly embraced some man or other from the provinces, who was presented to him.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"34c6"}},
{"insert":"　　A circle of students formed round the table, and they spoke of the nonsense paid for by the State which was uttered from the rostrum in the Sorbonne, then the conversation fell upon the faults and omissions in Guicherat's dictionaries and grammars.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5f58"}},
{"insert":"　　Marius interrupted the discussion to exclaim:","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"fbf9"}},
{"insert":"　　\"But it is very agreeable, all the same to have the cross!\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"f623"}},
{"insert":"　　\"That's queer!\" whispered Courfeyrac to Jean Prouvaire.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"92ae"}},
{"insert":"　　\"No,\" responded Prouvaire, \"that's serious.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"7c4e"}},
{"insert":"　　It was serious; in fact, Marius had reached that first violent and charming hour with which grand passions begin.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ce62"}},
{"insert":"　　A glance had wrought all this.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"803b"}},
{"insert":"　　When the mine is charged, when the conflagration is ready, nothing is more simple.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"639a"}},
{"insert":"　　A glance is a spark.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"90a8"}},
{"insert":"　　It was all over with him.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"d95f"}},
{"insert":"　　Marius loved a woman.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"75ef"}},
{"insert":"　　His fate was entering the unknown.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"734b"}},
{"insert":"　　The glance of women resembles certain combinations of wheels, which are tranquil in appearance yet formidable.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"0570"}},
{"insert":"　　You pass close to them every day, peaceably and with impunity, and without a suspicion of anything.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"79f1"}},
{"insert":"　　A moment arrives when you forget that the thing is there.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ac92"}},
{"insert":"　　You go and come, dream, speak, laugh.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3a86"}},
{"insert":"　　All at once you feel yourself clutched; all is over.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"dbef"}},
{"insert":"　　The wheels hold you fast, the glance has ensnared you.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"6761"}},
{"insert":"　　It has caught you, no matter where or how, by some portion of your thought which was fluttering loose, by some distraction which had attacked you.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"f203"}},
{"insert":"　　You are lost.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"7809"}},
{"insert":"　　The whole of you passes into it.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4231"}},
{"insert":"　　A chain of mysterious forces takes possession of you.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ed65"}},
{"insert":"　　You struggle in vain; no more human succor is possible. You go on falling from gearing to gearing, from agony to agony, from torture to torture, you, your mind, your fortune, your future, your soul; and, according to whether you are in the power of a wicked creature, or of a noble heart, you will not escape from this terrifying machine otherwise than disfigured with shame, or transfigured by passion.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　ADVENTURES OF THE LETTER U DELIVERED OVER TO CONJECTURES","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3d2c"}},
{"insert":"　　 Isolation, detachment, from everything, pride, independence, the taste of nature, the absence of daily and material activity, the life within himself, the secret conflicts of chastity, a benevolent ecstasy towards all creation, had prepared Marius for this possession which is called passion.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"b227"}},
{"insert":"　　His worship of his father had gradually become a religion, and, like all religions, it had retreated to the depths of his soul.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"386d"}},
{"insert":"　　Something was required in the foreground.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"aa27"}},
{"insert":"　　Love came.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4e95"}},
{"insert":"　　A full month elapsed, during which Marius went every day to the Luxembourg.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"d3fe"}},
{"insert":"　　When the hour arrived, nothing could hold him back.--\"He is on duty,\" said Courfeyrac.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"35fd"}},
{"insert":"　　Marius lived in a state of delight.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"d5d3"}},
{"insert":"　　It is certain that the young girl did look at him.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"d379"}},
{"insert":"　　He had finally grown bold, and approached the bench.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"b2ae"}},
{"insert":"　　Still, he did not pass in front of it any more, in obedience to the instinct of timidity and to the instinct of prudence common to lovers. He considered it better not to attract \"the attention of the father.\" He combined his stations behind the trees and the pedestals of the statues with a profound diplomacy, so that he might be seen as much as possible by the young girl and as little as possible by the old gentleman.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a811"}},
{"insert":"　　Sometimes, he remained motionless by the half-hour together in the shade of a Leonidas or a Spartacus, holding in his hand a book, above which his eyes, gently raised, sought the beautiful girl, and she, on her side, turned her charming profile towards him with a vague smile.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"9dea"}},
{"insert":"　　While conversing in the most natural and tranquil manner in the world with the white-haired man, she bent upon Marius all the reveries of a virginal and passionate eye. Ancient and time-honored manoeuvre which Eve understood from the very first day of the world, and which every woman understands from the very first day of her life! her mouth replied to one, and her glance replied to another.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"e2d2"}},
{"insert":"　　It must be supposed, that M. Leblanc finally noticed something, for often, when Marius arrived, he rose and began to walk about. He had abandoned their accustomed place and had adopted the bench by the Gladiator, near the other end of the walk, as though with the object of seeing whether Marius would pursue them thither. Marius did not understand, and committed this error.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"51db"}},
{"insert":"　　\"The father\" began to grow inexact, and no longer brought \"his daughter\" every day.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"143c"}},
{"insert":"　　Sometimes, he came alone.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"90f1"}},
{"insert":"　　Then Marius did not stay. Another blunder.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"270c"}},
{"insert":"　　Marius paid no heed to these symptoms.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"b0ce"}},
{"insert":"　　From the phase of timidity, he had passed, by a natural and fatal progress, to the phase of blindness.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"714a"}},
{"insert":"　　His love increased.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3c36"}},
{"insert":"　　He dreamed of it every night. And then, an unexpected bliss had happened to him, oil on the fire, a redoubling of the shadows over his eyes.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3058"}},
{"insert":"　　One evening, at dusk, he had found, on the bench which \"M. Leblanc and his daughter\" had just quitted, a handkerchief, a very simple handkerchief, without embroidery, but white, and fine, and which seemed to him to exhale ineffable perfume.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"48f5"}},
{"insert":"　　He seized it with rapture. This handkerchief was marked with the letters U. F. Marius knew nothing about this beautiful child,--neither her family name, her Christian name nor her abode; these two letters were the first thing of her that he had gained possession of, adorable initials, upon which he immediately began to construct his scaffolding. U was evidently the Christian name.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5d0f"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Ursule!\" he thought, \"what a delicious name!\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"9c61"}},
{"insert":"　　He kissed the handkerchief, drank it in, placed it on his heart, on his flesh, during the day, and at night, laid it beneath his lips that he might fall asleep on it.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"cef5"}},
{"insert":"　　\"I feel that her whole soul lies within it!\" he exclaimed.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"b236"}},
{"insert":"　　This handkerchief belonged to the old gentleman, who had simply let it fall from his pocket.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a0f9"}},
{"insert":"　　In the days which followed the finding of this treasure, he only displayed himself at the Luxembourg in the act of kissing the handkerchief and laying it on his heart.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3175"}},
{"insert":"　　The beautiful child understood nothing of all this, and signified it to him by imperceptible signs.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"6b45"}},
{"insert":"　　\"O modesty!\" said Marius.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　THE VETERANS THEMSELVES CAN BE HAPPY","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"87a2"}},
{"insert":"　　 Since we have pronounced the word modesty, and since we conceal nothing, we ought to say that once, nevertheless, in spite of his ecstasies, \"his Ursule\" caused him very serious grief.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3fb8"}},
{"insert":"　　It was on one of the days when she persuaded M. Leblanc to leave the bench and stroll along the walk.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"98c3"}},
{"insert":"　　A brisk May breeze was blowing, which swayed the crests of the plaintain-trees. The father and daughter, arm in arm, had just passed Marius' bench.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"c90d"}},
{"insert":"　　Marius had risen to his feet behind them, and was following them with his eyes, as was fitting in the desperate situation of his soul.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"178e"}},
{"insert":"　　All at once, a gust of wind, more merry than the rest, and probably charged with performing the affairs of Springtime, swept down from the nursery, flung itself on the alley, enveloped the young girl in a delicious shiver, worthy of Virgil's nymphs, and the fawns of Theocritus, and lifted her dress, the robe more sacred than that of Isis, almost to the height of her garter.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"e099"}},
{"insert":"　　A leg of exquisite shape appeared.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"81d9"}},
{"insert":"　　Marius saw it.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5f0c"}},
{"insert":"　　He was exasperated and furious.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3333"}},
{"insert":"　　The young girl had hastily thrust down her dress, with a divinely troubled motion, but he was none the less angry for all that.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4bd1"}},
{"insert":"　　He was alone in the alley, it is true.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"8382"}},
{"insert":"　　But there might have been some one there. And what if there had been some one there!","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"2c7f"}},
{"insert":"　　Can any one comprehend such a thing?","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"d331"}},
{"insert":"　　What she had just done is horrible!--Alas, the poor child had done nothing; there had been but one culprit, the wind; but Marius, in whom quivered the Bartholo who exists in Cherubin, was determined to be vexed, and was jealous of his own shadow. It is thus, in fact, that the harsh and capricious jealousy of the flesh awakens in the human heart, and takes possession of it, even without any right.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"7e78"}},
{"insert":"　　Moreover, setting aside even that jealousy, the sight of that charming leg had contained nothing agreeable for him; the white stocking of the first woman he chanced to meet would have afforded him more pleasure.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"f18e"}},
{"insert":"　　When \"his Ursule,\" after having reached the end of the walk, retraced her steps with M. Leblanc, and passed in front of the bench on which Marius had seated himself once more, Marius darted a sullen and ferocious glance at her.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"c641"}},
{"insert":"　　The young girl gave way to that slight straightening up with a backward movement, accompanied by a raising of the eyelids, which signifies:","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　\"Well, what is the matter?\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5f73"}},
{"insert":"　　This was \"their first quarrel.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　Marius had hardly made this scene at her with his eyes, when some one crossed the walk.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"7f8a"}},
{"insert":"　　It was a veteran, very much bent, extremely wrinkled, and pale, in a uniform of the Louis XV. pattern, bearing on his breast the little oval plaque of red cloth, with the crossed swords, the soldier's cross of Saint-Louis, and adorned, in addition, with a coat-sleeve, which had no arm within it, with a silver chin and a wooden leg.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"8721"}},
{"insert":"　　Marius thought he perceived that this man had an extremely well satisfied air. It even struck him that the aged cynic, as he hobbled along past him, addressed to him a very fraternal and very merry wink, as though some chance had created an understanding between them, and as though they had shared some piece of good luck together.

{"insert":"　　Admit, compassionate man, that it is necessary to suffer the most cruel need, and that it is very painful, for the sake of obtaining a little relief, to get oneself attested by the authorities as though one were not free to suffer and to die of inanition while waiting to have our misery relieved.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　In the first place, not one of the signers gave his address.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"e543"}},

{"insert":"　　Moreover, and this rendered the conjecture all the more probable, the coarse and yellow paper was the same in all four, the odor of tobacco was the same, and, although an attempt had been made to vary the style, the same orthographical faults were reproduced with the greatest tranquillity, and the man of letters Genflot was no more exempt from them than the Spanish captain.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"232e"}},
{"insert":"　　It was waste of trouble to try to solve this petty mystery.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"57e3"}},
{"insert":"　　Had it not been a chance find, it would have borne the air of a mystification. Marius was too melancholy to take even a chance pleasantry well, and to lend himself to a game which the pavement of the street seemed desirous of playing with him.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3317"}},
{"insert":"　　It seemed to him that he was playing the part of the blind man in blind man's buff between the four letters, and that they were making sport of him.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4b44"}},
{"insert":"　　A very young girl was standing in the half-open door.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"da81"}},
{"insert":"　　The dormer window of the garret, through which the light fell, was precisely opposite the door, and illuminated the figure with a wan light. She was a frail, emaciated, slender creature; there was nothing but a chemise and a petticoat upon that chilled and shivering nakedness. Her girdle was a string, her head ribbon a string, her pointed shoulders emerged from her chemise, a blond and lymphatic pallor, earth-colored collar-bones, red hands, a half-open and degraded mouth, missing teeth, dull, bold, base eyes; she had the form of a young girl who has missed her youth, and the look of a corrupt old woman; fifty years mingled with fifteen; one of those beings which are both feeble and horrible, and which cause those to shudder whom they do not cause to weep.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"e715"}},
{"insert":"　　Marius had risen, and was staring in a sort of stupor at this being, who was almost like the forms of the shadows which traverse dreams.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"6b50"}},
{"insert":"　　The most heart-breaking thing of all was, that this young girl had not come into the world to be homely.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"08d5"}},
{"insert":"　　In her early childhood she must even have been pretty.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"f970"}},
{"insert":"　　The grace of her age was still struggling against the hideous, premature decrepitude of debauchery and poverty. The remains of beauty were dying away in that face of sixteen, like the pale sunlight which is extinguished under hideous clouds at dawn on a winter's day.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3404"}},
{"insert":"　　That face was not wholly unknown to Marius.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　He thought he remembered having seen it somewhere.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"df9f"}},
{"insert":"　　\"What do you wish, Mademoiselle?\" he asked.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ec9e"}},
{"insert":"　　The young girl replied in her voice of a drunken convict:--","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　\"Here is a letter for you, Monsieur Marius.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　How did she know his name?","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a6a2"}},
{"insert":"　　Without waiting for him to tell her to advance, she entered. She entered resolutely, staring, with a sort of assurance that made the heart bleed, at the whole room and the unmade bed.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3938"}},
{"insert":"　　Her feet were bare.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"2a61"}},
{"insert":"　　Large holes in her petticoat permitted glimpses of her long legs and her thin knees.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"998d"}},
{"insert":"　　She was shivering.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a30a"}},
{"insert":"　　She held a letter in her hand, which she presented to Marius.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　P.S. My eldest daughter will await your orders, dear Monsieur Marius.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"1d7d"}},
{"insert":"　　This letter, coming in the very midst of the mysterious adventure which had occupied Marius' thoughts ever since the preceding evening, was like a candle in a cellar.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"45b8"}},
{"insert":"　　All was suddenly illuminated.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5f27"}},
{"insert":"　　This letter came from the same place as the other four. There was the same writing, the same style, the same orthography, the same paper, the same odor of tobacco.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3a04"}},
{"insert":"　　There were five missives, five histories, five signatures, and a single signer.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3f94"}},
{"insert":"　　The Spanish Captain Don Alvares, the unhappy Mistress Balizard, the dramatic poet Genflot, the old comedian Fabantou, were all four named Jondrette, if, indeed, Jondrette himself were named Jondrette.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3aca"}},
{"insert":"　　Marius had lived in the house for a tolerably long time, and he had had, as we have said, but very rare occasion to see, to even catch a glimpse of, his extremely mean neighbors.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"6f0f"}},
{"insert":"　　His mind was elsewhere, and where the mind is, there the eyes are also. He had been obliged more than once to pass the Jondrettes in the corridor or on the stairs; but they were mere forms to him; he had paid so little heed to them, that, on the preceding evening, he had jostled the Jondrette girls on the boulevard, without recognizing them, for it had evidently been they, and it was with great difficulty that the one who had just entered his room had awakened in him, in spite of disgust and pity, a vague recollection of having met her elsewhere.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ce71"}},
{"insert":"　　Now he saw everything clearly.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"17c0"}},
{"insert":"　　He understood that his neighbor Jondrette, in his distress, exercised the industry of speculating on the charity of benevolent persons, that he procured addresses, and that he wrote under feigned names to people whom he judged to be wealthy and compassionate, letters which his daughters delivered at their risk and peril, for this father had come to such a pass, that he risked his daughters; he was playing a game with fate, and he used them as the stake.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"2ae5"}},
{"insert":"　　Marius understood that probably, judging from their flight on the evening before, from their breathless condition, from their terror and from the words of slang which he had overheard, these unfortunate creatures were plying some inexplicably sad profession, and that the result of the whole was, in the midst of human society, as it is now constituted, two miserable beings who were neither girls nor women, a species of impure and innocent monsters produced by misery.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"d22f"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a28c"}},
{"insert":"　　Souls which blossomed out yesterday, and are faded to-day, like those flowers let fall in the streets, which are soiled with every sort of mire, while waiting for some wheel to crush them. Nevertheless, while Marius bent a pained and astonished gaze on her, the young girl was wandering back and forth in the garret with the audacity of a spectre.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"f441"}},
{"insert":"　　She kicked about, without troubling herself as to her nakedness.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3bc6"}},
{"insert":"　　Occasionally her chemise, which was untied and torn, fell almost to her waist.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"7acd"}},
{"insert":"　　She moved the chairs about, she disarranged the toilet articles which stood on the commode, she handled Marius' clothes, she rummaged about to see what there was in the corners.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"52e0"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Hullo!\" said she, \"you have a mirror!\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"39c4"}},
{"insert":"　　And she hummed scraps of vaudevilles, as though she had been alone, frolicsome refrains which her hoarse and guttural voice rendered lugubrious.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"49b5"}},
{"insert":"　　An indescribable constraint, weariness, and humiliation were perceptible beneath this hardihood.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a3be"}},
{"insert":"　　Effrontery is a disgrace.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"8f3c"}},
{"insert":"　　Nothing could be more melancholy than to see her sport about the room, and, so to speak, flit with the movements of a bird which is frightened by the daylight, or which has broken its wing. One felt that under other conditions of education and destiny, the gay and over-free mien of this young girl might have turned out sweet and charming.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　That is only to be seen among men.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"9751"}},
{"insert":"　　Marius reflected, and allowed her to have her way.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"58ed"}},
{"insert":"　　She approached the table.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"66f5"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Ah!\" said she, \"books!\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　A flash pierced her glassy eye.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　\"I know how to read, I do!\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ce0b"}},

{"insert":"　　Waterloo was against the English.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"7993"}},
{"insert":"　　She laid down the book, caught up a pen, and exclaimed:--","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　\"And I know how to write, too!\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"1341"}},

{"insert":"　　I have a little brother who is a friend of the artists, and who gives me tickets sometimes.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"1ab5"}},
{"insert":"　　But I don't like the benches in the galleries. One is cramped and uncomfortable there.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　There are rough people there sometimes; and people who smell bad.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a6a8"}},
{"insert":"　　Then she scrutinized Marius, assumed a singular air and said:--","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　She tried to render her voice soft, but only succeeded in making it very deep.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3a8f"}},
{"insert":"　　A portion of her words was lost in the transit from her larynx to her lips, as though on a piano where some notes are missing.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　As we did not wish to be beaten, as that is useless, as that is entirely useless, as that is absolutely useless, we said that we had carried the letters to the proper persons, and that they had said to us: `Nix.'

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"2c0b"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"1fde"}},
{"insert":"　　So it was you that we jostled as we passed last night.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"600c"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"f7f4"}},

{"insert":"　　I'll go and carry it to him. Perhaps he will give us something to breakfast on.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a764"}},

{"insert":"　　Parbleu! if you are not satisfied, dogs, burst!\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a6d4"}},
{"insert":"　　This reminded Marius of the wretched girl's errand to himself. He fumbled in his waistcoat pocket, and found nothing there.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"6446"}},
{"insert":"　　The young girl went on, and seemed to have no consciousness of Marius' presence.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　\"I often go off in the evening.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"fc81"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"b97e"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"6afc"}},
{"insert":"　　`No, it's too cold.' I go out alone, whenever I choose, I sometimes sleep in the ditches.

{"insert":"　　`Why, there's water there!'","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"f09b"}},
{"insert":"　　The stars are like the lamps in illuminations, one would say that they smoked and that the wind blew them out, I am bewildered, as though horses were breathing in my ears; although it is night, I hear hand-organs and spinning-machines, and I don't know what all.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"1f09"}},
{"insert":"　　And then she stared at him with a bewildered air.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"c886"}},
{"insert":"　　By dint of searching and ransacking his pockets, Marius had finally collected five francs sixteen sous.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"1683"}},
{"insert":"　　This was all he owned in the world for the moment.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　\"At all events,\" he thought, \"there is my dinner for to-day, and to-morrow we will see.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"7b95"}},
{"insert":"　　He kept the sixteen sous, and handed the five francs to the young girl.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"bcd3"}},
{"insert":"　　She seized the coin.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"688f"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Good!\" said she, \"the sun is shining!\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"f639"}},
{"insert":"　　And, as though the sun had possessed the property of melting the avalanches of slang in her brain, she went on:--","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"0f9d"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Five francs! the shiner! a monarch! in this hole!","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"53e7"}},
{"insert":"　　She pulled her chemise up on her shoulders, made a low bow to Marius, then a familiar sign with her hand, and went towards the door, saying:--","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　\"Good morning, sir.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"6bd9"}},
{"insert":"　　As she passed, she caught sight of a dry crust of bread on the commode, which was moulding there amid the dust; she flung herself upon it and bit into it, muttering:--","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　\"That's good! it's hard! it breaks my teeth!\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　Then she departed.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3dbd"}},
{"insert":"　　A ROSE IN MISERY ","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"e63a"}},
{"insert":"　　A very young girl was standing in the half-open door.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"7eaa"}},
{"insert":"　　The dormer window of the garret, through which the light fell, was precisely opposite the door, and illuminated the figure with a wan light. She was a frail, emaciated, slender creature; there was nothing but a chemise and a petticoat upon that chilled and shivering nakedness. Her girdle was a string, her head ribbon a string, her pointed shoulders emerged from her chemise, a blond and lymphatic pallor, earth-colored collar-bones, red hands, a half-open and degraded mouth, missing teeth, dull, bold, base eyes; she had the form of a young girl who has missed her youth, and the look of a corrupt old woman; fifty years mingled with fifteen; one of those beings which are both feeble and horrible, and which cause those to shudder whom they do not cause to weep.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"e87c"}},
{"insert":"　　Marius had risen, and was staring in a sort of stupor at this being, who was almost like the forms of the shadows which traverse dreams.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"26f0"}},
{"insert":"　　The most heart-breaking thing of all was, that this young girl had not come into the world to be homely.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"d1af"}},
{"insert":"　　In her early childhood she must even have been pretty.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"672b"}},
{"insert":"　　The grace of her age was still struggling against the hideous, premature decrepitude of debauchery and poverty. The remains of beauty were dying away in that face of sixteen, like the pale sunlight which is extinguished under hideous clouds at dawn on a winter's day.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"8451"}},
{"insert":"　　That face was not wholly unknown to Marius.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ec6f"}},
{"insert":"　　He thought he remembered having seen it somewhere.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"d50e"}},
{"insert":"　　\"What do you wish, Mademoiselle?\" he asked.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"dc68"}},
{"insert":"　　The young girl replied in her voice of a drunken convict:--","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"bc1e"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Here is a letter for you, Monsieur Marius.\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a5cc"}},
{"insert":"　　She called Marius by his name; he could not doubt that he was the person whom she wanted; but who was this girl?","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"f159"}},
{"insert":"　　How did she know his name?","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"2228"}},
{"insert":"　　Without waiting for him to tell her to advance, she entered. She entered resolutely, staring, with a sort of assurance that made the heart bleed, at the whole room and the unmade bed.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"c3f8"}},
{"insert":"　　Her feet were bare.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5fbe"}},
{"insert":"　　Large holes in her petticoat permitted glimpses of her long legs and her thin knees.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"e4bc"}},
{"insert":"　　She was shivering.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"333c"}},
{"insert":"　　She held a letter in her hand, which she presented to Marius.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　Marius, as he opened the letter, noticed that the enormous wafer which sealed it was still moist.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"2863"}},
{"insert":"　　The message could not have come from a distance.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"1f7e"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ade2"}},
{"insert":"　　My amiable neighbor, young man:","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"0ae1"}},
{"insert":"　　I have learned of your goodness to me, that you paid my rent six months ago.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"33c0"}},
{"insert":"　　I bless you, young man. My eldest daughter will tell you that we have been without a morsel of bread for two days, four persons and my spouse ill.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"e718"}},
{"insert":"　　If I am not deseaved in my opinion, I think I may hope that your generous heart will melt at this statement and the desire will subjugate you to be propitious to me by daigning to lavish on me a slight favor.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"fdf3"}},
{"insert":"　　I am with the distinguished consideration which is due to the benefactors of humanity,-- ","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　P.S. My eldest daughter will await your orders, dear Monsieur Marius.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"89b3"}},
{"insert":"　　This letter, coming in the very midst of the mysterious adventure which had occupied Marius' thoughts ever since the preceding evening, was like a candle in a cellar.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"60c7"}},
{"insert":"　　All was suddenly illuminated.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"d377"}},
{"insert":"　　This letter came from the same place as the other four. There was the same writing, the same style, the same orthography, the same paper, the same odor of tobacco.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"b8e3"}},
{"insert":"　　There were five missives, five histories, five signatures, and a single signer.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"115a"}},
{"insert":"　　The Spanish Captain Don Alvares, the unhappy Mistress Balizard, the dramatic poet Genflot, the old comedian Fabantou, were all four named Jondrette, if, indeed, Jondrette himself were named Jondrette.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"e3bc"}},
{"insert":"　　Marius had lived in the house for a tolerably long time, and he had had, as we have said, but very rare occasion to see, to even catch a glimpse of, his extremely mean neighbors.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"6326"}},
{"insert":"　　His mind was elsewhere, and where the mind is, there the eyes are also. He had been obliged more than once to pass the Jondrettes in the corridor or on the stairs; but they were mere forms to him; he had paid so little heed to them, that, on the preceding evening, he had jostled the Jondrette girls on the boulevard, without recognizing them, for it had evidently been they, and it was with great difficulty that the one who had just entered his room had awakened in him, in spite of disgust and pity, a vague recollection of having met her elsewhere.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"f7a2"}},
{"insert":"　　Now he saw everything clearly.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"681b"}},
{"insert":"　　He understood that his neighbor Jondrette, in his distress, exercised the industry of speculating on the charity of benevolent persons, that he procured addresses, and that he wrote under feigned names to people whom he judged to be wealthy and compassionate, letters which his daughters delivered at their risk and peril, for this father had come to such a pass, that he risked his daughters; he was playing a game with fate, and he used them as the stake.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ecf1"}},
{"insert":"　　Marius understood that probably, judging from their flight on the evening before, from their breathless condition, from their terror and from the words of slang which he had overheard, these unfortunate creatures were plying some inexplicably sad profession, and that the result of the whole was, in the midst of human society, as it is now constituted, two miserable beings who were neither girls nor women, a species of impure and innocent monsters produced by misery.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"d22e"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"4a3e"}},
{"insert":"　　Souls which blossomed out yesterday, and are faded to-day, like those flowers let fall in the streets, which are soiled with every sort of mire, while waiting for some wheel to crush them. Nevertheless, while Marius bent a pained and astonished gaze on her, the young girl was wandering back and forth in the garret with the audacity of a spectre.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"8fa9"}},
{"insert":"　　She kicked about, without troubling herself as to her nakedness.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"112e"}},
{"insert":"　　Occasionally her chemise, which was untied and torn, fell almost to her waist.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"f753"}},
{"insert":"　　She moved the chairs about, she disarranged the toilet articles which stood on the commode, she handled Marius' clothes, she rummaged about to see what there was in the corners.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"1d50"}},
{"insert":"　　\"Hullo!\" said she, \"you have a mirror!\"","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　And she hummed scraps of vaudevilles, as though she had been alone, frolicsome refrains which her hoarse and guttural voice rendered lugubrious.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"6495"}},
{"insert":"　　An indescribable constraint, weariness, and humiliation were perceptible beneath this hardihood.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a354"}},
{"insert":"　　Effrontery is a disgrace.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"8426"}},
{"insert":"　　Nothing could be more melancholy than to see her sport about the room, and, so to speak, flit with the movements of a bird which is frightened by the daylight, or which has broken its wing. One felt that under other conditions of education and destiny, the gay and over-free mien of this young girl might have turned out sweet and charming.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　So it was you that we jostled as we passed last night.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　\"I often go off in the evening.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　`No, it's too cold.' I go out alone, whenever I choose, I sometimes sleep in the ditches.

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"9209"}},
{"insert":"　　The stars are like the lamps in illuminations, one would say that they smoked and that the wind blew them out, I am bewildered, as though horses were breathing in my ears; although it is night, I hear hand-organs and spinning-machines, and I don't know what all.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　And then she stared at him with a bewildered air.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"e991"}},
{"insert":"　　By dint of searching and ransacking his pockets, Marius had finally collected five francs sixteen sous.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"8639"}},
{"insert":"　　True misery he had but just had a view of. It was its spectre which had just passed before his eyes. In fact, he who has only beheld the misery of man has seen nothing; the misery of woman is what he must see; he who has seen only the misery of woman has seen nothing; he must see the misery of the child.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},

{"insert":"　　Health, youth, honor, all the shy delicacies of the young body, the heart, virginity, modesty, that epidermis of the soul, are manipulated in sinister wise by that fumbling which seeks resources, which encounters opprobrium, and which accomodates itself to it.

{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"169d"}},
{"insert":"　　She revealed to him a hideous side of the night.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"a1fc"}},
{"insert":"　　Marius almost reproached himself for the preoccupations of revery and passion which had prevented his bestowing a glance on his neighbors up to that day.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"18d5"}},
{"insert":"　　The payment of their rent had been a mechanical movement, which any one would have yielded to; but he, Marius, should have done better than that.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"3bcd"}},
{"insert":"　　What! only a wall separated him from those abandoned beings who lived gropingly in the dark outside the pale of the rest of the world, he was elbow to elbow with them, he was, in some sort, the last link of the human race which they touched, he heard them live, or rather, rattle in the death agony beside him, and he paid no heed to them! Every day, every instant, he heard them walking on the other side of the wall, he heard them go, and come, and speak, and he did not even lend an ear!","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5cf2"}},
{"insert":"　　And groans lay in those words, and he did not even listen to them, his thoughts were elsewhere, given up to dreams, to impossible radiances, to loves in the air, to follies; and all the while, human creatures, his brothers in Jesus Christ, his brothers in the people, were agonizing in vain beside him! He even formed a part of their misfortune, and he aggravated it. For if they had had another neighbor who was less chimerical and more attentive, any ordinary and charitable man, evidently their indigence would have been noticed, their signals of distress would have been perceived, and they would have been taken hold of and rescued! They appeared very corrupt and very depraved, no doubt, very vile, very odious even; but those who fall without becoming degraded are rare; besides, there is a point where the unfortunate and the infamous unite and are confounded in a single word, a fatal word, the miserable; whose fault is this?","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"6ce4"}},
{"insert":"　　And then should not the charity be all the more profound, in proportion as the fall is great?","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"5160"}},
{"insert":"　　While reading himself this moral lesson, for there were occasions on which Marius, like all truly honest hearts, was his own pedagogue and scolded himself more than he deserved, he stared at the wall which separated him from the Jondrettes, as though he were able to make his gaze, full of pity, penetrate that partition and warm these wretched people.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"b69f"}},
{"insert":"　　The wall was a thin layer of plaster upheld by lathes and beams, and, as the reader had just learned, it allowed the sound of voices and words to be clearly distinguished. Only a man as dreamy as Marius could have failed to perceive this long before.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ae74"}},
{"insert":"　　There was no paper pasted on the wall, either on the side of the Jondrettes or on that of Marius; the coarse construction was visible in its nakedness.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"ce09"}},
{"insert":"　　Marius examined the partition, almost unconsciously; sometimes revery examines, observes, and scrutinizes as thought would.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"29f4"}},
{"insert":"　　All at once he sprang up; he had just perceived, near the top, close to the ceiling, a triangular hole, which resulted from the space between three lathes. The plaster which should have filled this cavity was missing, and by mounting on the commode, a view could be had through this aperture into the Jondrettes' attic.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
{"insert":"\n","attributes":{"line":"8296"}},
{"insert":"　　Commiseration has, and should have, its curiosity.","attributes":{"author":"7743577"}},
